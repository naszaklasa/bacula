Trademark:
The name Bacula is a registered trademark.

===================================

License:
For the most part, Bacula is licensed under the GPL version 2 or greater         
and any code that is Copyright Kern Sibbald and John Walker with the GPL
indication is so licensed, but with the following four additions:

Linking: 
Bacula may be linked with any libraries permitted under
the GPL, or with any non-GPLed libraries, including OpenSSL, that
are required for its proper functioning, providing the source
code of those non-GPLed libraries is non-proprietary and freely available.

Termination for IP or Patent Action: 
In addition to the termination clause specified in the GPL, this
license shall terminate automatically and you may no longer
exercise any of the rights granted to you by this license as of
the date you commence an action, including a cross-claim or
counterclaim, against any licensor of GPL software alleging that
the software infringes an intellectual property right or a
patent.  Special dispensation from or delay to the execution of
this clause may be possible by applying directly to the license
owner of this software.  Such a dispensation or delay is valid
only in writing and signed by the one or more of the license
holders.

IP rights:
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe
the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
entity.  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise.  As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
intellectual property rights needed, if any.  For example, if a
third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
acquire that license before distributing the Program.

Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
