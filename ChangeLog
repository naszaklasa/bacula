Changes to 1.36.3 released 23Apr05:
22Apr05
- Correct return type of ftello to avoid overflow --
  thanks to Peter Eriksson.
13Apr05
- Fix seg fault if Name directive missing in Job resource.
12Apr05
- Add new LaTeX doc to 1.36.2 branch.
- Fix SuSE autostart routines to use /etc/init.d instead
  of /etc/rc.d/init.d.
- Increase index size on File table Name and Path table Path
  to improve performance.
- Second fix for not zeroing SD pointers on restarted job.
- Turn off old style Include/Excludes.
01Apr05
- Use fseeko and ftello so that attributes can exceed 4GB
- Flush console output after every line.
- Turn off Multiple Connections in catalog resource, which
  causes corruped databases.  It is silently ignored.
- Drop support for old style Include/Exclude.  There is a
  perl script that will convert them.
- Inhibit trying to reset attributes on a Win32 drive.
18Mar05 1.36.2-store.patch
- This patch fails a job if no Storage resource is specified and
  the job attempts to call the SD.
18Mar05 1.36.2-reschedule.patch
- This patch should fix a Segfault bug when a job is rescheduled.
  The storage pointers were being released when they should not
  have been.
17Mar05 1.36.2-restore-speed.patch
- This patch will fix a subtle bug that was introduced in 1.36.2
  which causes Bacula to be very slow restoring a few files. This
  is because it reads completely to the end of the Volume rather
  than stopping when all the files on the Volume are loaded. The
  introduction of the bug was caused by a patch that fixed 
  Bacula truncating tapes after a restore.
  Note that all source files will be rebuilt during the make.
16Mar05 1.36.2-console.patch
- This patch causes the output directed to a file to be
  flushed after every line. This is a bit overkill, IMO, but
  a user complained about it.
15Mar05 1.36.2-netbsd.patch
- This patch corrects a compile problem because of no statfs() 
  on NetBSD. The patch was submitted by kardel with bug 258.
09Mar05 1.36.2-win32-drive.patch
- This patch will prevent the Win32 FD from printing an error message
  when it attempts to restore the permissions for a drive (which Win32
  doesn't permit). The error is harmless in any case.
04Mar05 1.36.2-level.patch
- This patch should fix a problem with th %l editing in the 
  client (FD) where it edited nothing. With this fix, it should
  edit "since".  
04Mar05 1.36.2-pool.patch
- This patch corrects a problem preventing multiple 
  simultaneous jobs from different pools.

Changes to 1.36.2 released 28Feb05:
27Feb05
- Fix pointer to stack variable in Verify jobs.
- Change reference to DEV_BSIZE to B_DEV_BSIZE to
  avoid colision with some OSes.
- Release storage[i] in job.c if allocated when            
  starting/restarting a job. Avoids orpahanned buffers.
24Feb05
- Add awk check to configure.in
- Bring over a few files from 1.37.
18Feb05
- Fix some lower case character problems in sql_cmds.c reported
  by Debian.

- Merge a few minor things from the 1.37 stream.
14Feb05
- Add a number of new features from 1.37, and apply fixes  
  for all known bugs. See ReleaseNotes for details.
- Apply Tim's patch for ACLs.

- Fixed acquiring a tape so that it does not block all acquires
  when operator intervention is needed.
- Platform build script updates from Scott

- Add grep ONLINE to wait_for_drive() in mtx-changer.in
- More doc.
- Rebuild Scott's new configure

Version 1.36.0 released 21Oct04:

  by a (long int) so that it works with 64 bit machines.
- Add more debug to heartbeat.c in FD for problem of dropped connections.
18Oct04

  started late and stopped early as suggested by Marc Williams.
18Oct04

  key index on File proposed by Martin, and to fix up a few
  minor things with PostgreSQL.
- Apply Christopher Hull's patch for getting the catalog correct
  during a restore.
- Created a patch for 1.34.6 (and code in 1.35) to detect passing
  the A option to the FD, which means enable ACL processing.
  Submitted by Ben Vitale.
13Oct04
- Fix syntax error in make_mysql_tables.in pointed out by Scott.
12Oct04
- Add a kludge to detect bad date/times, which cause a seg fault in
  Microsoft's version of localtime_r().  So, now we know that Microsoft
  programmers do not check return codes!
- Minor update to web site (new projects page).
- Remove bigint for filenameid from postgresql table -- as demonstrated
  by Martin, it has negative performance repercussions.
- Rework getuser() and getgroup() to avoid any possible race condition 
  by returning the value in a buffer rather than from the cached table.

- Fix segfault in editing numbers in count command of restore tree.
- Add missing #define for IPV6 found by Martin in address_conf.c
- Use strcasecmp() instead of strcmp() in address_conf.c
07Oct04
- Fix bug where SD crashes on label if drive is not open
  (i.e. Always Open = no).
- Added "Rerun Failed Levels = yes/no"
- Made calling offline_or_rewind() non-fatal if the
  device is not open.
- Added Martin's suggestion to have multiple level index on
  the file table.

Changes to 1.35.7:
03Oct04
- Apply Martin's patch that puts back the run pool override
  code -- dumb me for removing it.

Changes to 1.35.6:
02Oct04
- Create patches/README and the patch summary file.
- Use different share mode when opening files on WinMe/98/95 since
  SHARE_DELETE is not implemented on those systems.
- In new syntax Includes, pass *all* files through the acceptance
  filter so that no error messages will be printed for files that
  cannot be opened if they are excluded.
01Oct04
- Fix bug 126 (Martin) -- prevent failed console label request from 
  going into fixup code and thus trying to update the catalog.
- Always fold case in fnmatch() on Win32 systems
30Sep04
- Create patches directory
- Apply Martin's patch for fixing console modifications to Verify Jobs.
- Fix Win32 so that it can backup files that are opened by programs
  such as Word (certain open system files cannot be backed up).

Changes to 1.35.5:
29Sep04
- Fix Storage overrides in Run directive
- Fix seg fault in AlertCommand
- Fix btape "test" and "fill" commands to work with new SD
  data structures.  There are still problems ...
26Sep04
- Correct buffer length passed to inet_ntop() in address_conf.c
- Increase the debug level of a lot of messages to reduce the
  debugging "noise".
- Modify how ST_APPEND is handled so that nothing is written
  to the Volume if it is not set. It is now set only when
  the Volume label is verified, and released when the volume
  is released. This required a number of minor but rather
  critical and fundamental changes.
- Improve quickly terminating a job in the SD when it errs.
  More status checking and a few additional checks on
  job_canceled() and check more error return statuses.
- Added a number of debug statements (to be removed later) that
  check the VolCatName for a name.
- Create a single subroutine that handles terminating writing
  on a Volume at the end of the volume (or after an error).
- Continued to add use of the berrno classs for strerror().
25Sep04
- Apply conio patches supplied by Peter Eriksson for configure.in
  conio.h and conio.c to make it work better on Solaris.
- Make run_grub print manual procedure for installing grub
- Add extra setsockopt keepalive.
- Add code to set as many options as possible in the system
  tape driver for different OSes.
24Sep04
- Apply Peter Eriksson's patch to configure.in fixes finding
  correct libs on Solaris to link conio -- bug 121
- Add expected number of files to Verify VolumeToCatalog, and
  if it does not equal the examined files, fail the job.
  Fixes bug -- 114
- Modify the depend section of each Makefile.in to reference $(CXX)
  instead of $(CC) -- bug 118
- Remove the word "restore" from the Volumes needed message in
  dird/bsr.c since the message is used for Restore and Verify.
- Fix initialization and copying of the storage resource when
  starting jobs (and in jobq.c when restarting). In some cases
  jcr->store was not set causing a segfault -- bug 116
23Sep04
- More doc.
- Pass EndFile and EndBlock to SD.  
22Sep04
- Fixed bscan to close() drive between tapes.
- Turn on transactions for SQLite and PostgreSQL if
  multiple connections are turned on.
- Removed stripping of filename in ua_tree insertion routine.
- Fix split_path_and_filename() routines to return zero length
  path and files.
- Modify update_tables scripts to convert a single blank filename
  into an empty filename.
- Incremented the release number because this version requires
  an update to the database.
  Use:
    cd src/cats
    ./update_bacula_tables  
  to update an existing database.
- Implemented EndFile and EndBlock in the Media record. This will
  allow Bacula to know exactly when to stop reading a tape if the
  stupid tape driver does not give a logical end of tape indication 
  and Bacula writes to the end of the tape getting an I/O error.
- Added new routines to update the database, and there are
  new database creation routines to add the two new Media columns.
- The Media record is updated each time a JobMedia record is created.
  This keeps the Media record up to date.
- Undid the code to use automatic type converions to char * in
  POOL_MEM. This is due to the ugly consequences of essentially
  destroying the class type nature of the class.
- Removed all the old mp_char() #define code.

Changes to 1.35.4:
22Sep04
- Add additional doc.
- Implement automatic POOL_MEM type conversion to char *. Thanks
  to Martin Simmons for the suggestion.
- Remove some unneeded function overloading -- need removed by
  automatic type conversion.
21Sep04
- Correct segfault in message.c with debug=200 (new code).
- Fix bug 109 verify with no options prints garbage.
- Add ioctl(MTIOCGET) call to clrerror_dev() in dev.c. As reported
  by Frank Kardel, this should clear error conditions on NetBSD.
20Sep04
- Modify the rescue script to create mount_drives with
  the order specified by Philip Nash (mkdir, mount).
- Tweak install chapter of French manual to add new paragraph
  from English.
- Tweak restore tree message to be a bit clearer.
- Modify watchdog to wakeup after 60 seconds, or wakeup if
  there is work to do.
- Modify watchdog stop routine to "ping" watchdog so that it
  stops immediately rather than after sleep time.
- Fix btape to use new dcr blocks rather than its own.
- Fix butil.c to correctly handle Volume names for the
  utility routines (broke when updating to dcrs).
11-19Sep04 (vacation)
- Implement multiple Storage specifications in the Job resource
  (AND) each containing multiple specifications (OR). Not yet functional.
  Note, this needs more work as most things now use
  job->storage[0]->first() rather than looping through devices.
- Implement "Multiple connections = yes/no" in Catalog record for
  allowing multiple simultaneous connections to the database.
- Add new mac.c (Migrate, Archive, Copy) to dird -- not yet implemented.
- Implement a new POOL_MEM class that automatically allocates
  and deallocates a pool buffer.
- Overload a number of utility routines to permit using both
  POOLMEM and POOL_MEM.
- Start converting to using POOL_MEM.
- There were a number of Bacula console ACL checks missing in
  ua_run.c. It allowed users to run jobs they really should not.
- Correct a number of dates on the Copyright.
- Overload pm_strcpy() and pm_strcat() to handle new POOL_MEM
  class.
- Overload bash/unbash_spaces to handle new POOL_MEM class.
- Make a *MASSIVE* pass through the Storage daemon eliminating
  all use of jcr->VolumeName and jcr->VolCatInfo in favor of
  dcr->...  
- Eliminate all all redundant arguments from calling sequences
  in SD. This poses a number of problems due to the old way blocks
  and records were allocated and released all the time. They are
  now contained in the dcr. The problem is that old habits die hard
  and there are still places where everything is not right.
- Implement "Block positioning = yes/no" in Device resource in SD.

Changes to 1.35.3:
09Sep04
- Add "Multiple Connections = yes/no" in catalog record. Only
  the variable is implemented, no code yet.
- Close *all* FD unless debug on. 
08Sep04
- Add first cut of UTF-8 support to conio. It "seems" to be working
  pretty well. Moving by words will definitely not work though.
- Improve detection and setting of gateway in the 
  network_start script.
07Sep04
- Modify scan code so that in most places scanning will
  continue across the end of a line.
05Sep04
- Begin major phase of 1.35 documentation.
- All outstanding bugs are fixed.
- Implement changes and improvements to rescue scripts as
  proposed by Gaurav.
05Sep04
- Add correction to Phil's previous patch.
- Send all queued messages in SD and FD prior to closing down    
  the job.
- Send queued messages in Jobs before terminating the job 
  so that the messages print before the job report.
- Add a destructor so that the Console ACLs are properly
  freed.
04Sep04
- Implement isolinux boot disk.
- Integrate Phil Stracchino's code (thanks for Matt's help).
  It permits lists and ranges of jobids on the delete as in:
  delete job jobid=1,3,5,11-16
03Sep04
- Apply Mike Acar's suggestion when looking for the next volume
  to check purged volumes for recycling before doing a purge.
- Make some improvements to CDROM disk.
- Take another crack at ignoring drive open() errors during
  polling.
02Sep04
- Add eliminate orphaned job records; eliminate admin records,
  and eliminate restore records to dbcheck.
- replace sprintf by bsnprintf() in dbcheck.
- Added scan target to makefile in rescue cd to print scsi
  devices.
- Added argument to berrno::strerror() to pass errno.
- Cleaned up a few more old strerror() calls and eliminated a
  few of the now unnecessary set_errno() calls.
- Fixed a bug in the polling code that prevented more than 100
  label reads (insanity check disabled if polling).
- Ignore bad return from open_device() if polling.
- Short circuit code if fatal error return from read_label() in
  mount.c
01Sep04
- Add index file to JobId field of File records for PostgreSQL.
- Correct several bugs in the job queue scheduler concerning   
  rescheduled jobs: 1. The SD status was not cleared causing a
  wrong status to be displayed by Dir after rescheduling. 2. All
  rescheduled jobs became zombies because the jcr use_count was
  not decremented properly.
- Make the Catalog resource required in Client records.
- Order the listing of where a file is (item 2 on the restore
  menu) by StartTime.
- Clarify when a filename only and a full path + filename must
  be entered in items 2 and 8 of the restore menu.
- Fix logic error in resolution of names on IPv4 systems.

Changes to 1.35.2 released 01Sep04:
30Aug04
- Inhibit printing of FileSet for a restore as it is misleading.
- Cleaned up a number of minor scripting problems with the CDROM
  creation.
- Fixed a race condition causing a Director crash on termination,
  if a large number of SIGHUPs were sent during a multiple concurrent
  set of backups.
28Aug04
- Completed integration of Rescue CD scripts with Bacula source.
28Aug04
- Added Ignore FileSet Changes = yes
- Added more error checking to the spooling code.
24Aug04
- Applied a patch from Peter Eriksson that removes a dynamic stack
  allocation (replaced by alloca) and fixes some const problems.
- Fixed a free() of a static variable in the new IP code bnet.c
- Got the new Bacula Rescue CDROM booting.
- Replaced a dynamic template by a simple store when using the
  native C compiler.
- Reworked some of the block.c error handling.
- Changed a Dmsgx(000, to Dmsgx(100 in dev.c that was dumping
  debug output on a user.
- Integrated patch from 1.34.6 block.c to 1.35
17Aug04
- Fix conio.c problem on Solaris.
- Add debug code to lock_jcr_chain().
- Lock jcr chain around less code.
- Implement call by reference for Mmsg() and pm_strxxx() to
  simplify calls.
- New IP address specification is used as follows:
    [sdaddresses|diraddresses|fdaddresses] = { [[ip|ipv4|ipv6] = { 
           [[addr|port] = [^ ]+[\n;]+] }] }

  so it could look for example like this:
     SDaddresses  = { ip = {
            addr = 1.2.3.4; port = 1205; }
        ipv4 = {
            addr = 1.2.3.4; port = http; }
        ipv6 = {
            addr = 1.2.3.4;
            port = 1205;
        }
        ip = {
            addr = 1.2.3.4
            port = 1205
        }
        ip = {
            addr = 1.2.3.4
        }
        ip = {
            addr = 2001:220:222::2
        }
        ip = {
            addr = bluedot.thun.net
        }
     }
  as a consequence, you can now specify multiple IP addresses and
  ports to be used. In the case of a server, it will listen on
  all those that you specify. In the case of connecting to the server,
  Bacula will attempt connecting to one at a time until it succeeds.
  And, in a few other special cases, Bacula will use only the first
  address specified.

  The default port numbers are still the same and the services and hosts 
  are also resolved by name. So now  you could use the real names for the 
  port numbers.

- Fix config from Andy Wettstein's patch to use bitypes.h and detect
  uint32_t, ... definitions.
- Fix a few compiler warnings because of casting pointers to int and
  vise versa.
- Do some minor cosmetics to query.sql. nothing changed.
- Don't call stop_thread_timer() in backup.c if timer not started.
- Fix bug with out of order JobIds on restore.
- Make watchdog examine queues once every 10 seconds instead of once
  a second.
22Jul04
- Add more bools to dev.c
- Fix walking attached DCRs in bscan.c
21Jul04
- Doc updates
- Start work on rescue files. Integrated RAID changes. 
- Print a message when query.sql moved to query.sql.old during install.
- Move setting of FreeBSD chflags() to after utime() to avoid error
  messages is immutable bit is set.
18Jul04
- Turn off heartbeat in FD when -s is given so that we can 
  debug without a flood of signals.
- Close and reopen the device during an append test in
  btape. This better tests appending as if Bacula stops/restarts.
- Remove old attach/detach_jcr_to_device() code
- Add new attached_dcrs code.
- Remove unnecessary subroutine for bsnprintf.
- Replace sprintf() by home-grown code in edit_uint64 ...
- Begin implementation of dev->attached_dcrs. 
17Jul04
- Remove scripts/fd.in from configure.in
- Add printing of JobId when a Job is started from the console.
16Jul04

  (i.e. with a config file).
- Made RH start scripts use -u and -g options.
- Many more DCR changes.
- Add job message indicating that the job has been rescheduled
  and when.
- Fix job end time so that it is always updated. Previously it
  was not updated when a job was rescheduled.

  pickup the wrong JobId -- submitted by a user.
- Add a number of "%s" in editing database errors -- security issue.
- Ensure that the NumVols is incremented and decremented in the
  pool record when Volumes are created or deleted.
- Cleanup error handling when labeling a tape. If vol was read-only,
  the device would still be marked as having found a label.
09Jul04
- Put ftCreationTime into st_ctime of stat packet. Hopefully
  this will fix the problem of noticing files have been moved
  into the save path after a Full save.
- Fix bug in "status dir" where not all entries are listed.

- Optimize a couple of insertions in binary_insert of dlists.

Release 1.35.0 08 July 2004:
08Jul04
- Apply Christopher Hull's const patch for PostgreSQL
- Add code to block.c to detect if block header is destroyed.
- Add debug code for memset checking for zeroing 1900-3000 bytes
  which is what happened to the block headers.
- If block header is destroyed, read the next block. Probably
  should return with new status similar to the SHORT block 
  return.
- Add more debug info to bls for bad blocks.
- More implementation of DCRs.
07Jul04
- Eliminate argument passing in SD by using dcr.
- More int->bool conversions.
- Add file:block to a number of read/write error messages.
04Jul04
- More int -> bool conversions.
- Modify the SD piece by piece to use DCRs everywhere.
- Cleanup some printout for query command. 
- Fix typo in cats/mysql.c
- Work on cleaning up tape driver a bit (use bools, better calling
  sequences).

  res_head array was one too small.
- Added Errors to last_job list. This allows detecting jobs
  that terminated in a warning.
- Implement setting the Win32 icon to yellow instead of red
  when the job terminated OK but with warnings.

  a bit tricky, requiring to truncate the file so that a despooling
  will work correctly. Needs to be tested.
- Make better subroutines for setting up for a new job.
- Start putting all DB ids on #defines (going to 64 bits).
- Fix gnome-console Makefile.in to work again.
- All "level=Incremental/Decremental" to the estimate command. This
  required some re-arrangement of subroutines at a fairly low level.
25Jun04

  catalog status when a backup job starts running.
24Jun04
- Add (char*) cast to readline call in console.c for old readlines.

  bytes, max_bytes, buffers and max_buffers.
- Fixed reload algorithm to stack both job end callback and the
  table id.

- Correct socket close on Win32 in bnet.c (in addition to compat.cpp).
  Caused fd leak in Win32 for each connection.
- Remove vol labeled test in askdir update_volume_info so that non-labeled
  Volume in catalog can be marked in error.
- Close socket in SD when connection rejected. Caused fd leaks.
- Initialize job_start_wait cond variable after every new_jcr() otherwise
  NetBSD gets error in library when trying to delete it without being inited.
- Fix typo (9 instead of 0) return status in write_new_volume_label.
- Fix mount.c to call routine that correctly marks a volume in error.
- Move code to rewrite volume label to subroutine -- a bit cleaner.
18Jun04

  cats library from Gnome console build; remove old version from Gnome
  About box. Thanks Andreas.
14Jun04
- Applied Peter Eriksson's const changes to the source code. Thanks Peter.
- Implemented a binary_insert() method for dlists -- intended to be used
  in the restore tree routines.
- Turned on my bsscanf() code, which replaces sscanf() by my routines, which
  are a subset of sscanf() used by Bacula, but which have known 32/64 bit
  behavior rather than vendor dependent !@#$%*.

- Implement bsscanf() because sscanf on FreeBSD amd64 stores
  in 64 bit words for %ld. Turned on for the moment only for
  FreeBSD amd64.
- Fix all conversions of ptr to int to use (long unsigned) this
  works on i386 and amd64.

  Volume was in the catalog but didn't exist -- or was zero bytes 
  long.
10Jun04

  to Hans-Ulrich Schaefer.
06Jun04
- Zero Slot if not autochanger in stored/mount.c

- Trap NULL DCR in block.c
- Add additional info to failed btape test pointing user to manual.
- Undefine DCR, which is defined on some stupid systems.
- Fix stored/dircmd.c not to quote Volume name on label query so that
  "update slots scan" works right (the quotes confused it).
- Fix autochanger.c not to attempt to unload a slot if the prior loaded
  request returned -1.
01May04
- In testing for Mike Acar's problem. I *finally* found and nailed
  the mount command that did not release a waiting job. The return
  of a stolen lock forgot to broadcast.
- In examining Mike Acar's problems, it appears that the Bacula

- Added nice graphics produced by Aristedes Maniatis giving an
  overall view of Bacula.
- Changed textdomain to be "bacula" in all progs.

  simultaneous jobs is enabled. This occurred only when on job had
  blocked another because of resource usage. This caused a deadlock
  and CPU usage. Reported by Michel Meyers.
- Changed the backup report to indicate "Backup OK -- with warnings
  if any warning messages were generated.
- Change output of restore report to indicate:
  "Restore OK -- warning file count mismatch"
- Make backup report say "Backup OK with warnings" if either FD or SD

  schedule. Thanks to Matt Howard for this.


2004-04-06 Version 1.34.0 06Apr04 Release
06Apr04
- Turn off SIGQUIT in console.
05Apr04
- A good number of document updates.
- Fixed the order which multiple files are accepted for 
  inclusion in the restore tree due to the fact that PostgreSQL

  dlist chain.
- Fix termination of last_jobs list by removing broken code.
31Mar04
- Update dbcheck to fix Paths without a trailing slash and Filenames
  with a trailing slash.
30Mar04
- Add -p option to all SD programs including bacula-sd. It causes
  Bacula to proceed or forge on in case of I/O errors. It is unlikely
  this will help, and it is strongly recommended against running
  the daemon with this option in production.
- Tweaked the Makefile not to create the gnome directories except
  when doing a gnome install.
28Mar04
- Implement Qmsg() queuing of messages to prevent recursion especially
  for bnet.c where recursion is fatal.

  default.
- The "done" keyword on the restore command prevents user interaction
  with the tree routines -- used mainly for scripting (regression ...).

- Add alphabetic sorting of siblings so the "dir" and "ls" commands
  during restore show files in alphabetic order.
25Mar04
- Based on Mike Acar's suggestions rework tree insert routines. Improve
  performance by using a last_sibling link for inserts.
24Mar04
- Apply corrected SQL to sql_get.c supplied by Dan Langille.
- Implement "delete job jobid=xxx jobid=yyy ..."
- Implement "purge volume=xxx volume=yyy ..."
- Fix buffer overrun in query string substitution.

- Hunt down missing free_locked_jcr() in SD that caused zombies.
- Modify status outputs to be more consistent for zombie checking.
- Add tests to regression script for zombie jobs.
- Set EIO in dev_errno for all error returns when bad data found. This
  fixes ERR=Success messages.
- Make error messages all contain ERROR for easy regression testing.
- Add sanity check in DIR for VolFiles becoming smaller.
18Mar04

13Mar04
- Added two tar files that Phil sent for adding slackware support.
  Thanks Phil and Matt Howard.
- Fix relabel command -- || should have been &&.
- Correct once more the scheduling algorithm -- this time it should
  be much better.
12Mar04
- Implement simple spool statistics printed by "status sd".
- Cleanup/add spool error messages.
- On multiple ctl-c, exit from console quickly.
- Implement code to select a different Volume in the SD if the
  current Volume is busy -- requested by Patrick Cole.
- Change postgreSQL make tables to use bigint instead of integer 
  for StartBlock and EndBlock because
  there is no unsigned integer in postgreSQL and these fields use 32 bits.
- Implement multiple drive autochanger support -- prompted by email of
  Patrick Cole.
11Mar04
- Update version and date in Win32 build.
- Fix bug in run_conf with month range zapping wday and wom.
- Correct editing of port for PQsetdbLogin in postgresql.c as reported
  by J. Conroy, and do a second try.

- Add SpoolDirectory to SD Device resource.
- Add MaximumJobSpoolSize to SD Device resource.
- Add MaximumSpoolSize to SD Device resource.
- Implement the above.
- Make despooling lock the device so only it writes
  to the device during despooling.
09Mar04
- Data spooling now passes the regression tests.
- Added "Files Expected" to the restore job report.
- Implemented SpoolData = yes/no in the Job resource
- Implemented SpoolData = yes/no in the Run overrides.
- Note, you must have a 1.33.4-09Mar05 SD or later with the Director since
  the DIR->SD protocol has changed to support data spooling.
- Remove the confusing "Which DBMS do you want to use (please select only one):"
  messages from ./configure.
- Fix broken Jmsg with missing argument in find_one.c
08Mar04
- Second cut data spooling code.
- Fix missing piece of yesterday's patch.
07Mar04
- Integrate patches supplied by Jason Conroy that fix Slot numbers 
  getting lost.
06Mar04
- This version contains a *major* addition to the SD structures.
  Many variables have been moved out of the JCR into a new DCR
  (Device Context Record). This required quite a few changes, and 
  introduced a bit of instability. In the end, after a few more
  rounds of changes, the DCR will replace virtually all arguments
  to the low level SD read/write routines. This change permits
  (with a bit more code) the SD to write to multiple devices at
  the same time for a single Job. It also facilitates adding the
  data spooling code.
- Added a patch that fixed the port specification for postgresql.
- Fixed findlib/find_one.c so that it will complain about backing
  up a hard linked file twice, which makes a restore impossible.
- Tighten up permissions on pid file.  
- Attempt to avoid warnings when casting 64 bit pointers to an
  integer.
- Added skeleton code for data spooling.
- Make sure spooled attributes are discarded on error.
03Mar04
- Updated getdiskinfo in rescue/linux to handle the fact that the
  sfdisk -s option now includes info on partitions. Also, before 
  creating the diskinfo files, clean out the old ones.
02Mar04
- Add debug and error output to jobq.c
- Fix some minor errors in debug output of scheduler.c
- Add "trace on/off" command and modify trace code in message.c
  to work off trace flag rather than #defines.
01Mar04
- If console is found during install warn user (new name is bconsole).
- On install copy console.conf to bconsole.conf if it exists.
- Make RunAfterJob error non-fatal.
- Rework minor details in status output.
- Attempt to define all values for "consoles" in JCR to avoid
  confusion.
28Feb04
- Use net start bacula to start Bacula on WinXP/NT/2K 
  systems after installation. 
- Change a few strcpy()s to bstrncpy()s in signal.
- Add "gui on/off" command to console to turn on gui mode,
  which will adapt Bacula better to batch or gui programs.
  Currently, it prevents commas from being inserted into
  numbers in the list command.
- Tweak some of the Makefiles so that the install is done with
  the right program (nothing really changed).
- Install logrotate in the "make autostart" of Bacula on RedHat.
- Implement SIGHUP while jobs are running. It *seems* to work but is
  a bit fragile and still crashes if you push it. More work needed.
- Applied Phil's GNOME 1.4 patch. Very clean. Thanks Phil.
- Major updates to the native Win32 installer.
27Feb04
- Restructure free of conf resources to handle job_end_push()
  and SIGHUP.  Lots of changes little substance.
26Feb04
- Add mtimeonly=yes/no and keepatime=yes/no to Include list           
  1.33 style.
- Allow no modifier in time and size specifications.
- Attempt to implement disk seeking. More work needed.
- Implement more in win32 installer and test it.
25Feb04
- Implement kb, mb, and gb modifiers for size, which mean
  1,000 bytes, 1,000,000, ... bytes.
- Add Makefile to src/win32 to allow building the full 
  release -- it calls nmake where appropriate.
- Remove the rsi directory from win32 as suggested by Christopher
- Add Michel Meyers' nsi file to win32 and integrate it with
  the build.
24Feb04
- Add the frigging _O_BINARY to the right variable. Win32 works!
- Add debug code to state file. There is a problem with Win32 read
  returning one byte less than it should.
- Implement a number of new functions for alist so that it has
  equivalent functionality to dlist.  It will be used for
  job_end_push().
- More work on state file. 
- Added a popup message box on Windows if Bacula Aborts.
- Attempt to shutdown the FD server, but doesn't work on Windows. This
  would have given a cleaner shutdown, no problem.
23Feb04
- Update projects
- Attempt to fix state file on Win32 -- no luck.
- Add HPUX tweaks to configure.in 
- Update quickstart and install.wml of doc.
- Eliminate extern int h_errno from bnet.c by including netdb.h
- Eliminate NumJobs from last_job structure so that FD and SD
  correctly report what is in the state file.
22Feb04
- Implement daemon state file, and save/restore last_jobs list.
- Fix time routines in win32 compat.cpp
- Fix a bug of not checking the bpipe_open() status in do_shell_expansion().
21Feb04
- Add Volker's bacula script to the SuSE directory and convert it
  to bacula.in
- Make LockRes() and UnlockRes() use read/write locks and have
  debug info to trace locking and unlocking.
- Begin work of implementing SIGHUP. It is now enabled for
  the Director and works only if there are no jobs running,
  in addition, if the new conf file is incorrect, it will
  terminate Bacula. Much more work to be done.  I've figured
  out a scheme to implement it with running jobs without
  adding individual semaphores or use counts.  
- Sort "list jobs" by StartTime rather than JobId, which can
  be random.
16Feb04
- Add a lot of "const" to char * arguments to keep the native
  Sun compiler happy.
- Added first cut of message queuing to prevent recursion in
  low level routines. This code is not yet working.
- Spent a *huge* amount of time looking at the tape driver
  code in the wake of several reports of tape labels getting
  trashed. The code looks fine.
- Created a tape with an error (by writing a block at the
  beginning of a tape that had valid data), and found that
  Under Linux there is no way to read past an I/O error.
  I tried mt; I tried my own program (btape); and I tried
  using scsitape, which talks directly to the scsi driver.
  This is *VERY BAD* news.
- I spent an *enormous* amount of time enhancing the btape
  test program as well as making the fill command work with
  both one and two tapes and the autochanger if configured.
  The multiple tape fill test is now quite comprehensive.
  It checks the last block on the first tape, the first block
  on the second tape, and the last block (11) on the second
  tape.
- Teaked the tape driver for several functions to use the 
  OS driver's notion of mt_file if there is an error.
13Feb04
- Add DB update scripts retrieved by Scott to a new updatedb
  directory at the top level.
- Add -p option to bcopy to allow ignoring errors on input.
- COALESCE(xx,0) does not work on PostgreSQL because the 0 is not a 
  correct time. Replaced by adding LastWritten IS NULL to the sort
  line as was first suggested by JML.
12Feb04
- Use COALESCE(LastWritten, 0) in sql_find.c to get NULLs to sort last.
  See note above.
- Add write/read and positioning test to btape "test" program.
10Feb04
- Fix bad printf of InChanger flag reported by Pascal Pederiva.
- Fix bad indexing off stack in authenticate.c reported by
  Pascal Pederiva.
09Feb04
- Add \n to hosts.access reject message.
- Implement security message class and make hosts.access message use
  that class.
08Feb04
- Fix check_memory bug in ua_query.c, which gives a bus error on Solaris.
  This affected only the query command.
07Feb04
- Added backup to cdwriter script to examples provided by Johan Decock.
- Fixed a bug where ls really did lsmark (just invert command table
  entries).
- Fix bug where a soft linked file and a directory had the same name
  by treating the soft link as a directory and putting the entries under
  it. This fixes the bug reported by Alexander Mueller.
- Fix a deadlock situation in the new watchdog code where the 
  watchdog locks its semaphore, and attempts to lock the jcr_chain,
  but another thread has locked the jcr_chain and wants to free a
  watchdog, which tries to lock the watchdog semaphore -- deadlock!
  Used read/write locks to solve the problem. 
- Improved the error messages when I/O errors or buffer id errors
  are detected, and prevent non-sense errors from being printed.
- Fix some incorrect messages in restore if no name is supplied
  on the command line (e.g. pool= ).
- Add the third digit to the release version number.
04Feb04
- Add -l option to bls that causes it to ignore tape label errors.
03Feb04
- Correct problems with jobs scheduled at a later time by hand.
  Missing unlock(), backward test on pthread_create status.
- Fix setip crash reported by Alan Brown.
- Create bacula.spec.in in SuSE directory from Scott.
- Fix missing unlock() in ua_status on access denial.
- Lots of little cleanups, improving jcr use_count debug printing.
- Add EMSG to mem_pool utilization statistics.
01Feb04
- New bacula.spec.in file from Scott
- Add Scott's spec file to the platforms/suse directory
- Modify configure.in to make platforms/suse/bacula.spec
- Do not allow a resource name to be specified twice.

2004-01-30 Version 1.33-30Jan04 Release
30Jan04
- Apply Jess Guardiani's second fix to list autochanger volumes without
  opening the drive (necessary on FreeBSD if no tape is in the drive).
- Added Postgresql configure search libraries recommended by Alan Brown.
29Jan04
- Reworked the command line handler in restore to walk through the
  arguments one at a time. This makes the file= entries work correctly.
  Also reworked the code that takes the MediaType and finds a 
  storage device.
26Jan04
- I've noticed that the backups of Rufus, my development machine, can be
  "stuck" for about 12 hours, then suddenly they run. In running the 
  debugger, I see that it was stuck on the select() statement waiting
  for the Hello.  Why this happens I am not sure. I re-organized the code
  a bit because it didn't seem to be as robust as it could, but I cannot
  explain the problem. 
- As a consequence of the above, I have implemented a new bsock timer that
  can be started and stopped. This is based on Nic Bellamy's new watchdog 
  code. The timer is set with start_bsock_timer(bsock, timeout); If the
  timeout expires, the bsock will be marked as timed_out and interrupted
  with a pthread_kill() on the current thread.
- Added 5 minute bsock timers to all the opening Hello/authentication 
  exchanges between the various daemons.               
24Jan04
- New spec file from Scott.
- New patch file from Scott for create_sqlite_database
- Fix crash in run command if invalid pool specified on the command line
  and then the user cancels the Pool prompt.
- Separate Console and ConsoleFont resources in gnome2 conf files.
- Remove possibly bad ASSERTs from bnet.c
- Remove open() of device in dircmd.c, which fails on FreeBSD with
  an autoloader -- thanks to Jesse Guardiani for this fix.
20Jan04
- Remove all "hostname -s" from configure except for RedHat. Use uname -n instead.
- Implement SetIP command.
- Implement Close On Poll in Device resource on SD.
- Implement Full, Inc, and Diff Pools.
- Implement Access control lists for Consoles.
18Jan04
- Define default working_dir as /var/bacula/working.
- Implement setip console command to set new IP address for a Client.
17Jan04
- Implement maximum network buffer size directives.
- Good first cut at access control lists for the console.
- Optimize restore to select only latest Differential backup after
  the Full, and then all following Incremental backups. Previously
  everything after Full was selected.
16Jan04
- Organize kernstodo a bit (more to be done).
- Add client IP address to BSOCK structure.
- Use bit fields where appropriate in BSOCK structure.
- Pass UAContext to ua authenticate in Director, and make it
  set the appropriate console (or NULL for none).
- Tweak restore "run" argument handling and add "files" keyword.
- Add device name or Volume name to some SD messages.
15Jan04
- First cut multiple consoles.
14Jan04
- Update kernstodo
- Add quit command to restore tree handler.
- Make restore tree handler remember if a hard link is present, and
  in doing a mark, only get database entry if there is a hard link.
  mark commands thus run at least 2 orders of magnitude faster.
- Add files=xxx field to run command submitted for restore.   
- Add yes to restore run command if either yes or run is command line
  argument.
- Make "yes" on command line argument skip prompt for modification of
  run job.
- Add markdir and unmarkdir -- both affect only the directory in
  question and do not do a recursive descent.
- Make tree command automatically mark all higher level directories to
  be restored when a directory or a file is selected.  Such directories
  are indicated by preceding the name with a + to indicate that only
  the directory entry is selected and not the whole directory tree.
- Modify a few tree commands to walk through all arguments rather than
  just taking the first one.
13Jan04
- Update copyright date on changed files.
- Make mark command in restore tree run *much* faster by accessing database only
  if the file actually is hard linked -- determined at time tree it built by
  keeping a has_link bit in the tree entry.
12Jan04 
- Modify findlib/makepath.c to create all parent directories with full permissions.
  This should solve the access problems on restoring files on Win32 systems.
- Modify restore to report **** Restore Error **** if any error are found.
  I.e. a file could not be created.
- Change a few errors into warnings -- e.g. if permissions could not be set, but
  the file is actually restored.
11Jan04
- Replace bsd_queue with dlist in lib/watchdog.c
- Add Date: header to bsmtp.  Thanks to Meno Abels (abels) on SourceForge
  for reporting this.
- Remove ap==NULL check in src/lib/var.c as suggested by Christoph Barbian
  because ap (va_list) is a struct on the Alpha, so the code does not
  compile.
10Jan04
- Implement first cut of polling for a Volume.  New Device directive
   "Volume Poll Interval = xxx" where xxx is a time specification      
   (e.g. 5min). Default is off.
- Call pthread_cancel on SD msgchan only if the threadid is non-zero.
07Jan04
- Change RH autostart scripts to start in Dan's order.

2004-01-06 Version 1.33-06Jan04 Release
06Jan04
- Correct calculation of week of month in scheduler and in scheduled
  listing.
04Jan04
- Fix cancel of job waiting on mount to be a bit cleaner.
03Jan04
- Fix seg fault -- don't close db in db_open_database(). It must explicitly
  be called.
- Doc updates
- Allow purge of a single JobId from a Volume (code untested)
- Implement fix to keep SD from looping complaining about the wrong volume
  at the end of a tape -- reported by Phil, and fix confirmed by him. I cannot
  seem to reproduce the bug here.
- Clean up a few more strcpy()s.
01Jan04
- Fix configure.in FD User print per Lars.
- Doc update.
- New bacula.spec.in from Scott. Nice!
- Make RunAfterJob non-fatal if it errs since the Job has really  
  already completed the save.
- Replace sprintf with bsnprintf in message.c
31Dec03
- Note, this change affects only the Win32 FD.
- Fixed Win32 FD crash due to missing argument in status command. It
  always crashed if there was a job that had previously run.  Thanks to
  Christopher Hull for finding and diagnosing this problem.
29Dec03
- Fix SELECT as indicated by Dan in sql_get.c for returning Volume names.
- Fix last_jobs list crash for utility programs (btape, ...).
- Correct editing of FileSet name into SQL command.
- Allow calling watchdog stop without initialization for utility programs.
- Enhance btape test by attempting to forward space past the end of the tape.
- Detect CAP_FASTFSF in btape test as possible reason for failure.
- Attempt to prevent infinite loops in fsf_dev() if device not properly
  configured.
- Attempt to get correct file number on tape after backspacing at EOM. The    
  correction should resolve differences in OS tape driver implementations.
- Add ctl-c detection to bconsole. When reading from tty, interrupts any
  output from Bacula, when reading from a file, it terminates the reading
  and returns possibly exiting if it is a batch job.
- Create devel_bacula.in script and make it configure itself. Very similar
  to the new bacula.in.  
- Modify bacula.in to have separate file locations for each daemon -- makes
  it easier to make a new devel_bacula.in when there are changes.
- Remove old config files when rebuilding configure to avoid error msgs.
- Fix btape "test" to respect TWO EOF.
- Fix fsf_dev() to use system notion of file if it is valid after bsf_dev().
- Move btraceback.gdb to scripts directory on installl.
- Add new mandrake bacula.spec.in
28Dec03
- Find commonset of c_iflags that work with FreeBSD tcsetattr on terminals.
- Remove comments from string concatenation -- doesn't work on FreeBSD
  compiler.
- Moderately improve bpipe_close() errors. Must rethink status return.
- Eliminate some Emsgs in favor of Jmsgs.
27Dec03
- Add optional Pool keyword on restore command line. If specified, the pool
  used will be restricted to the specified pool.
- "Finish" implementation of JobDefs.
- Fix directory for chmod of cats scripts.
26Dec03
- Implement foreach_res() #define and start replacing old code.
- Work some more on jobdefs -- more to be done.
- Implement bstrftime_nc() bstrftime with no century.
- Fix static console problem in gnome2 and gnome directories reported by Alan 
  Brown.
- Add code to test for valid Resource Names. Permitted characters are now
  alpha, numeric, colon, period, minus, underscore, space.

- Add repeat counts on btape bsf, fsf, bsr, fsr, and weof commands.
- Enhance btape's fill command to be much clearer and more reliable.
- Add state file to btape so that unfill command can be done any time
  after a fill command.
- Use reposition_dev() to position for read back of last block.
22Nov03
- Zap InChanger flag only if setting Slot to non-zero.
- Added new SD directive TwoEOF, default off, that tells Bacula whether
  to write one or two EOFs for EOM.  For the OnStream driver it must
  be off, otherwise an empty file will be created.
- Cleaned up the btape "fill" command to compare the last block written
  and read rather than just printing them.
21Nov03
- Implement btape test for autochanger.
- Implement btape test for Fast Forward Space File.
- Moved up to cygwin 1.5.5-1
- Implemented Fast Forward Space File
20Nov03

  selecting from all available volumes.
- Ensure that Volumes are selected from oldest LastWritten data/time.
- A couple of bug fixes ensuring the proper ordering of volumes.
19Nov03
- Return oldest LastWritten for find_next_volume.
- Remove ASSERT from stored/acquire.c that could trip when it shouldn't.
- Enhance SD status if debug_level > 1 to show details of dev status.
18Nov03
- Create update_bacula_tables, ... scripts and modify configure and Makefiles
- Eliminate is_num() and use is_an_integer().
- Add user slot selection code "slots=1,2-3,5,10, ..."
- Start daemons at level 90 rather than 20 so that MySQL will already
  be started.
- Write alter_mysql_tables.in and alter_sqlite_tables.in
- Add Drive and InChanger to Media record.
- Update database level to 7.
- Add db_make_inchanger_unique() and call it when creating and updating
  the Media record.
- Add Drive and InChanger to database code for Media record.
- Allow changing InChanger flag in update command.
- First cut at allowing the user to specify slots for updating autochanger.
- Add scan to "update slots scan".
- Add command in SD to readlabel.
15Nov03
- In the bacula start/stop script, ordered the stop: FD SD Dir to
  give the SD the best chances of updating the catalog before dying.
- Add Drive and InChanger to MEDIA_DBR record and to Volume update
  from the SD.
- Reorganize the Volume info update from SD so that the Dir sends back the
  current information in case the Volume status has changed by expiring.
  The DIR-SD protocol is not backward compatible (must update).
- Fixed the signal handler to pass the signal to the exit_handler() 
  previously it passed 1.
- Modified SD so that on normal shutdown, it walks through all jcrs and
  cancels them so that the Volume status will be updated in the catalog.
- Found and fixed a bug where ST_LABEL was not set in append mode
  (when a different tape was accepted other than the original one
  proposed by the DIR.
- Update the catalog Volume info after dev->file is incremented rather
  than waiting for end of job.
12Nov03
- Change getdomainname() prototype for Darwin.
- Add gethost_strerror() to create correct error message for
  gethostbyname().
- After doing a kill() of a stalled connection in watchdog, turn off
  the timer to prevent an infinite loop.
- Allow Bacula to rewrite the label on a disk volume.
- Correct usage report printed by bsmtp.
11Nov03
- Complete changing references to bsmtp from smtp.
- Add L_NONE for Admin and Restore jobs and update level_to_str()
- Fix segfault from double free of RestoreBootstrap in job.c
10Nov03
- Change console to bconsole
- Change console.conf to bconsole.conf
- Change smtp to bsmtp
- Implement .bconsolerc
- Check if volume has expired when doing an update media for the SD
09Nov03
- Implement new code that assures that a non-zero Slot is unique within
  a given Pool. When setting a non-zero Slot, the Slot of all other
  Volumes with the same Slot is set to zero.  Redone later to add
  InChanger flag
07Nov03
- Fix bug reported by Lars where an incorrect Volume name was printed
  by the "status dir" command.
06Nov03
- Pretty up a few error messages printed by smtp.
- Make btime_t int64_t so that one can do arithmetic.
- Implement since as utime (64 bit UTC). 
- Compute clock diff between Dir and FD, and adjust since time.
- Apply SQL fix from Nic Bellamy (thanks).
- Apply John's zlib #ifdefing fix.
05Nov03
- Add Dan's with-sd-user, ... to configure.in.
- Add Dan's userid and group modifications to bacula.in
- Lots of documentation updates.
- Make console print "Enter a period to cancel a command" when starting.
- Fix the "list nextvol" command so that it doesn't try to close the
  database twice, giving a segfault.
- Fix (hopefully) to dircmd.c so that a mount request does a pthread_cond_signal.
  There was one path were the signal was not sent. This should fix the bug
  that requires you to do two "mount" commands to free a job waiting on a mount.
- Make dir_ask_sysop_to_mount_next_volume() return immediately if a slot is
  specified.
- Correct some of the messages in testfind.c (pointed out by Dan -- thanks).
- Alias fd to client, sd to storage.
- Changed order of Console commands so that short commands such as q (quit) 
  are more logical.

02Nov03
- Mainly a bug fix release.
- Do a clean of both Gnome directories.
- Require that FileSet id match when finding an Incremental
  previous job. This was already the case for a Full.
- Print message if no status returned from FD.
- Correct "Do not forget to mount the drive" message. Test was
  backward.
- "status dir" stopped scanning the run records on the first
  one that matched giving an incomplete listing.
- Edit commas in Bytes on "estimate" command output.

2003-10-30 Version 1.32c 30Oct03 Release
29Oct03
- Add %v to job edit codes. It edits in the VolumeName(s).
- Add code to ensure that fds 0,1, and 2 are defined by dup'ing them

- Add all possible Status codes the jobstatus_to_ascii()
25Oct03
- Add new spec file and cats patch from Scott.
- Optimize tree.c a bit -- turn off debug code, keep node fname
  length for fast rejection, add some statistics, allocate
  in 100K and 1Meg chunks, use bool, uint16_t and uint8_t to
  reduce node packet size.
24Oct03
- Eliminate ua_retention.c that was not used.
- Improve error message when closing brace missing in conf file.
- More doc updates.

- Correct SQL table definitions so that MySQL and SQLite
  have all the values in the same position.
- Correct a typo in configure.in when configuring GNOME.
- In doing a "status dir" make it loop over all the run
  commands in the Schedule rather than doing on the first one.
- Close all unused file descriptors in bpipe.c otherwise if
  a daemon is started, it will keep our TCP/IP port open.
22Oct03
- Print block read error (checksum, I/O, BB01, ...) once then
  the number found at the end of the reading.
- Implement RunAfterFailedJob
- Change db_find_job_start_time() to require a Full save before
  running an Incremental or Differential job.
- Remove has_volume_expired from code that updates vol info
21Oct03
- Implement "delete job"
20Oct03
- More documentation, add Marc Brueckner's tips to manual.
- Tweak gnome2-console scroll window.
- Turn off some debug info.
18Oct03

- Write most of the code for Verify Disk to Catalog.
- Recreate the src/gnome2-console directory.
- Change all the text handling code to the Gnome 2.0 way.
- Correct the way verify filenames are returned to the Director so
  that directories are in canonical form (i.e. trailing /).

2003-10-15 Version 1.32b 14Oct03 Release
14Oct03
- Modify configure so that if threaded MySQL client library
  is not present, Bacula will link with the non-threaded 
  version.

- Remove trademark symbol from title. Phil pointed out that it
  does not display correctly in a title.
11Oct03
- Implement restore by file before date. 
- Change restore arguments a bit so that you can feed it
  multiple jobid= specifications or multiple file= specifications.
- Pass restore with run option on to run_cmd.
- Make run-cmd not prompt if it has a "run" on the command line.
10Oct03
- When pruning, select only old orphanned jobs to delete so that
  the current job is not pruned too.
09Oct03
- Corrected return status for bsf_dev and bsr_dev in block.c and btape.c
- dev.c used incorrect ruturn status for bsf_dev in the BSF at EOM
  code. This caused all appends on FreeBSD to fail.
- Turn on fast block rejection code.
08Oct03
- Optimize file index searches by adding a count to the bootstrap.
- Write single files/blocks to bootstrap without the second part.
- Add current Volume status to the cannot use this Volume message.
- Zero the rx->bsr in ua_restore when freeing so it doesn't get
  freed twice.
- Lots of testing on the restore
- I noticed that SD and FD bootstrap files were not always
  deleted, so delete them as soon as possible.
- Restore by file (or by selecting files) created some
  horrible looking bsr files that defeated the forward
  spacing code, so fix write_findex to work right.
- Add zlib_strerror() routine in filed/restore in case
  of zlib errors.
- In filed/restore.c make sure all error returns cleanup
  and close the open file descriptor.
- Make sure to set *non* over filename in attr packet
  after file is found, so error messages that print the
  filename don't print an old, incorrect name.
- Allow bclose() to be called after closing the file.
- Fix a number of unclear help messages, ... reported by
  Phil in btape.
- Retweak stored/read_record.c so that it does forward
  spacing at the beginning of every tape, not just the
  first one.
- Print repositioning message if verbose is set.

2003-10-01 Version 1.32a 03Oct03 Release
04Oct03
- Combine the code in ua_output and ua_status that searches
  the run records.
03Oct03
- Fixed "list nextvol" to search for the correct pool in the
  Schedule Run records.
- Correct an error in is_block_zero. It found a false
  match if the first 1016 bytes of a 32K buffer and     
  the last 248 bytes are zero.  Broke the sparse option.
01Oct03
- More documentation.
- Test if multiple mail addresses works. Yes.
- Add debug Jmsg() to trigger if the file I/O packet is
  not closed in the FD, i.e file descriptor leaks.
- When error occurs reading label in mount.c, start from
  the very top so that the retry count is in effect.
- Zap the mode in soft links in testls.c for regression
  testing.

2003-10-01 Version 1.32 30Sep03 Release
28Sep03
- Enhance manual faq, regression ...
- Make FreeBSD read sizes always be a multiple of 512. Needed
  to read raw disks.

  disk reads.  On FreeBSD there are no block devices.
27Sep03
- Fix printing of EndTime on job report after rescheduling.
- Fix jobq.c error returns to clean up before returning.
- Make Cleaning tape aware of "unlabeled" volumes.
- If a job is rescheduled, ensure that old job is
  removed from SD's jcr queue -- i.e. it is still waiting
  for FD connection.
- Test rescheduling code.

- Yifang Dai reported a case where he stress tested Bacula and
  backed up to four volumes, but only two were selected for the
  restore. This is because I forgot that the selection could
  span a volume entirely.
- Added a missing CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS to the second attempt to open
  the MySQL database -- this prevents UPDATE errors if nothing
  actually changed.

- Clear a few linked lists in the temp directory packed in find_one.c
- Eliminate an unnecessary variable in attr.c
- Clear the cache pointer after release in idcache.c
- Implement a new C++ doubly linked list class.

2003-07-08 Version 1.31 Beta 08Jul03
- Update document for Win32 stuff.
- Ensure VolStatus value for update is permitted.
- Fix cached_path so that it is local to the jcr, otherwise, there
  are problems from job to job.
- Fixed idcache.c which was not thread safe and didn't release memory,
  and didn't always edit the userid correctly.
- Correct missing pool memory allocation in update voluseduration.
- Release mutex in pool_mem.c before triggering ASSERT.
- Lock database while recycling.
- Fix a bug in editing since where I forgot to update to the new size.  
- Implement all the command line update arguments.
- Modify label to use volume=xxx for the new volume and oldvolume=yyy
  if doing a relable.
- Added yes to run command line arguments.
- Clear errno in editing a string to utime.
- In restore print only volumes that will actually be used.
- Fix bextract -- add appropriate breaks in new case code.
- Add a new test -- bsr-opt-test for testing bsr optimization. As usual,
  it pointed out a bug where the directory tree handling code destroyed
  the restore arg list.
- Many updates to the manual.
- Pass prefix links flag to FD.
- Sort list of commands for Console
- Set default FD and SD concurrent jobs to 10.
- Rework the find next volume code in catreq.c to correct some minor
  but subtle logic errors and to eliminate a goto.
- Did spell check on manual.
- Removed bindtextdomain() as it conflicted with RH8.0 headers
- Fixed parse_args to pass address of POOLMEM struct.
- Constrain FileIndexes written to BSR to be within range of Volume.
- Suppress writing volumes to BSR if they are not actually referenced.
- Make FOPTS use alist for match and base entries.
- Pass prefix_links to SD.
- Add command line interface to most items in "update volume=xxx"
- Add command line interface to restore "jobid", "current", "before", "all".
- Add command line "yes" to run command to supress prompt.
- In new alist code, free only if allocated.
- Overload [] with get() code for alist.
- Fixed the code that wrote FirstIndex and LastIndex to the database. It
  was not correct at the end of a volume (basically included indexes in
  the second volume).
- Fixed bscan to work with the new code and to properly build JobMedia
  records.
- Added code to the read end of block.c to properly track Volume bytes,
  blocks, and files. I thought this was not necessary, but it is critical
  for bscan to work correctly.
- Modified read_record to properly track First/LastIndex -- needed by
  bscan.
- Eliminated some old Volume write code.
- Changed RecycleOldestVolume to PurgeOldestVolume
- Added what I hope are the "final" touches for Win32 stuff.  There
  are still a lot of annoying little problems.
- Added the "portable=yes/no" option to Include. If set, it disables
  use of BackupRead/Write for Win32, so in principle, the data should
  be portable.
- Pulled in more recent config.sub and config.guess from /usr/share/libtool
- Replaced the system fgets() by a Bacula version that ignores
  interrupts (i.e. signals).  This truncated output from child processes.
- Make file_index int32_t everywhere.
- Moved LinkFI into ATTR structure.  Also integrated data_stream there too.
- Moved code that sets the stream for writing into create_file.
- Removed a signal(SIG_IGN, SIGCHLD) from dird.c that prevented getting
  the status of child processes.  This allowed removing the FreeBSD 
  kludge to bpipe.c -- the status is now obtained correctly.
- Hand scan the stream header that arrives in append.c to avoid machine
  dependencies of sscanf().
- Implemented code to put Data stream in Attributes record. 
- Check if data stream is supported, if not, ignore.
- Fix crash when multiple Includes are given (missing parens).
- Clear WroteVol in askdir.c when JobMedia record is created.
- Implement simple array list class for use in Bacula.  New files
  are lib/list.c lib/list.h. Probably will not use until version 1.32.

2003-06-24 Version 1.31 Beta 22Jun03
- Change Purging Oldest Volume message to Recycling Oldest Volume.
- Limit results from find_oldest_volume to one.
- Fix possible buffer overrun in the restore tree handling routines.
- Fixed a crash in VerifyToVolume because I moved the close_db()
  down into the free_ua_context() and should not have done so.
- At a "var" command in the Console that does variable expansion and
  prints it.
- Implement first cut of estimate command.
- Change find_next_volume() for oldest to use LastWritten instead of
  FirstWritten -- also add Append to volumes slected.
- Do normal recycling before checking for RecycleOldestVolume.
- Implemented block rejection on read. This should make restores run
  much faster. Next release will have block positioning -- even faster.
- Very preliminary support for Gnome-2.0.  Text does not yet work.
- Correct buffer corruption in find_one.c with long directory names (Win32).
- Make setting owner on directories M_ERROR rather than M_WARNING.
- Fix printing of JobId in run listing for restore job.
- Reduce heartbeat read check interval to every 10 seconds on Cygwin because
  there is no working pthread_kill().
- I finally designed a test for multiple simultaneous jobs,
  and sure enough it broke when the jobs are split over multiple
  volumes.  Now fixed and working!
- Eliminated a few "duplicate" error messages by testing for canceled.
- Add ASSERT for device use count going negative.
- Fix BlockNumber checking in stored/read.c (got first one wrong).
- If socket is timed out, do a shutdown(fd,2) instead of close().
- Fixed return status from SD to FD by setting JobStatus in append_end() 
- Add arrays to Environment variables. Elements separated by |.
- Implement Reschedule On Error, Reschedule Interval, Reschedule Times.
- Add a new pool PM_NAME -- gets a name length buffer.
- Implement fast cancel of FD blocked on writing to SD by using
  pthread_cancel(). Turned off on Cygwin due to bug.
- Add code to handle EAGAIN in writing (probably not necessary). Use
  select().
- Eliminate size_t from pool control buffers.
- Complete Counter resource.
- Complete LabelFormat (except for WrapCounter) plus counter
  inrementation.
- This needs a database change to eliminate PoolId from counters.
- Made a more compact format for the document index.
- Add Phil's checkhost to examples directory (thanks Phil).
- Implement generalized LabelFormat (documentation to come).
- Implement Counter resource.
- Cleanup examples/kernsconfig
- Implement restore to a specific date.
- Fixed a but in automatic labeling (and use durations expiring) analysed
  and reported by Rob Proffitt (thanks!).
- Cleaned up a few Cygwin compile problems.
- Made a 10Jun03 release (it is in production here)
- Finally took the big plunge and fixed restoration of links and other
  files that have been changed between the backup and restore. Basically
  if the file exists, it is deleted, then re-created.
- Purge only Volumes marked Append, Full, Used, or Error.
- Allow pruning of volumes marked Append, in addition to Full and Used.


2003-06-10 Version 1.31 Beta 10Jun03
- Eliminated all plain email addresses and replaced them with " at " in
  place of @ to reduce havesting by spammers.  Doc + Web Site.
- Started working on making POOLMEM a struct rather than a char. Lots of
  work to do.
- Fixed bscan to handle -V option.
- Fixed bscan to handle two File volumes.
- Corrected a misplaced comma it get_fileset() in cats pointed out by bscan.
- Added two Volume bscan test to regression scripts -- write two volumes,
  purge and delete everything, bscan the tapes, and do a restore. It works!
- Reorganized the backup/restore code to move the attribute information into
  an ATTR packet, which is passed in place of tons of arguments.  Moved some
  code into lib/attr.c and lib/attr.h.  Then eliminated all the duplicate
  attribute code.
- Moved FT_ types into baconfig.h.
- Defined FT_ types to use only 16 bits. The upper half of the word is
  reserved for adding optional fields in the attributes packet.
- Moved jcr->where into common part of jcr and have it deleted in lib/jcr.c
- Put all attribute reading code on switch() with cases instead of a big
  if (restore.c, bls.c, bextract.c, bscan.c, ...)
- set_attributes() now takes ATTR packet, and thus has much fewer args.
- moved print_ls_output() into lib/attr.c  
- implemented is_stream_supported().
- create_file() now takes ATTR packet so has many fewer args.
- add mtime_only code.
- Rewrote bnet.c read and write routines to quit if bsock->terminated is
  set.  This will allow setting non-blocking writes and then receiving
  a termination message and terminating the Job immediately rather than
  waiting 2 hours for the line to timeout.
- Put catalog db name in some error messages.
- Code for restore is now much cleaner, with much of it in lib/attr.c,
  and it is now common for all readers.
- Add first cut of proper support for Win32 Backup code.
- Fix bug in restore Win95/98/Me.
- Pass mtime_only flag to FD. Needs config record.

2003-06-04 Version 1.31 Beta 04Jun03
- Fix block.c to check errno only in case of return status -1 as 
  suggested by Justin Gibbs (FreeBSD).
- Implemented qfill command in btape for quick testing write/read of a tape.
- Discovered that FreeBSD pthreads re-use the same thread id, which causes
  the SD to fail when a user leaves a device unmounted (old pid is reused
  and lock_device() thinks the same thread is calling again leading to
  inconsistent state). Set id to zero after blocking the device during
  unmount.
- A lot of clean up, moving subroutines around for TermCode.
- Free ua->prompt when Job terminates.
- Add AutoPrune and Recycle to values copied from Pool resource
  into Pool record on create/updated.
- Implemented bsr for Verify VolumeToCatalog. 
- Improved the Verify Job report using SD and FD term codes.
- Split tree handling routines from ua_restore.c to ua_tree.c
- Split bsr routines from ua_restore.c to bsr.c and bsr.h 
- Fixed clash between FD and SD returned job values. Report now contains
  values from FD.  Maybe I should change? or give both.
- Attempt to fix negative use_count for dev packet in SD by adding
  a couple of open_dev().   This may be cause of Dan's crash.
- Clear no_wait_id when device is unblocked. This may be cause of Dan's crash.
- Eliminate old "new lock code".
- Add configure of mtx-changer for mtx path.
- Always rewind tape before releasing it (for FreeBSD).
- StartBlock was one too large for second volume.
- Fixed restore to display status from both SD and FD.
- Unified return status message for backup and restore.
- Corrected segmentation fault reported by Dan when doing "label barcodes"
  on a File.
- Corrected a segmentation fault when attempting to send a JobMedia record
  to the Console -- reported by Dan.
- Added MySQL documentation for using the threaded libraries.
- Added new columns and tables to Catalog database.
- Wrote alter scripts and tested them (thanks to Dan for the help) on
  MySQL and SQLite.
- Started using enums where ever possible when passing flags to 
  subroutines. This helps make the source much more readable.
- Corrected a bug where a vertical database listing was being used in
  the query command.
- Added new argument to parse_args() to prevent command arg overflow.
- Renamed ua_db_query.c ua_query.c.
- Split scan.c out of lib/util.c
- Perhaps I have *finally* fixed the command line history in gnome-console.
- Added support for smartalloc for any global new or delete command
  by overloading the global operators.
- Made the default time with no qualifier day rather than seconds.
- Fixed a bug in the store_size() routine that improperly converted from
  double to uint32_t.
- Started using "bool" where possible.
- Zap SD session key once it is used.
- Added *lots* more checking for strcpy -- bstrncpy(), ... 
- Added CreateTime field to FileSet record and print it to distinguish
  FileSets. 
- Print an information message when a new FileSet is created.
- Include the FileSet date/time in the Job report.
- Indicate if a Job is upgraded in the Job report and from what previous level.
- Incremented the database version.
- Ensure that any DB error message is printed if the start_time of a previous
  save is not found.
- Free orphaned buffer in ua_restore.c in case of database error.
- Implement enum for response DISPLAY_ERROR and NO_DISPLAY
- Implement enum for create_pool (POOL_OP_CREATE, POOL_OP_UPDATE).
- Make sure FileSets printed in restore are in order.
- Add a number of bstrncat, and other protected string operations.
- Clean up old structs in dird_conf.h
- Remove all Slot invalidation code.
- Add Automatic choice message to all do_prompt() calls.
- Eliminate JobId from restore if not used.
- Clean up a few error messages.
- Make fill/unfill commands work correctly in btape.
- Enhance btape fill and unfill commands.
- Implement real Pmsg() code so that negative levels work in Dmsg()
- Implement block number check -- had to turn it off because it doesn't
  work.  Need to verify that it is the correct block and that block
  numbers are properly written.
- Moved readline from depkgs1 to depkgs.
- Reworked the configure code to handle readline correctly. This was broken
  mostly due to the fact that the readline routines are nested down one
  directory.  Also, I missed one header file that was needed (possibly added
  in a later version).
- Put correct include on the dependencies make for Console readline.
- Remove JobMediaId from VOL_PARAMS (no longer needed).
- Sort VOL_PARAMS by JobMediaId using SQL in cats.
- Add jcr as argument to block.c read_block... routines so that error
  messages are immediately displayed.
- Make bsr_dev() edit an error message if it is turned off and return 0.
- Add checking for the BlockNumber in the read routines -- lots of
  false matches are found -- much check writing end.
- Now sort bsr volumes by JobMediaId -- produces better results.
- It turns out that under certain circumstances, when doing a restore, the
  Volumes will not be written to the BSR in the correct order.  I don't
  know exactly why, but many thanks to Dan Langille for reporting this.
  The solution is to sort the Vol_Params within each bsr (done), and to
  sort the bsr chain (not yet implemented). Note, the bsr chain should
  always be in order unless the user explicitly specifies the JobIds in
  a different order.          
- Began implementing C++ structs rather than typedef structs as in C.
- Added volatile to a lot of variables that are used in two threads at
  the same time. This should prevent improper optimization.   
- Fixed a missing space in the "run job=xxx where=" the where was
  glued to the end of the previous stuff (bootstrap filename). 
- I *finally* found the cause of the mysterious failure of shell expansion.
  It was due to the read() getting interrupted!  That's what opening up
  SIGCHLD will do!
- Remove unused default tape drive names.
- Create a new status.c file in stored and split the status code out of dircmd.c

2003-05-22 Version 1.31 Beta 22May03
- I discovered that C++ permits "prototyping" structures e.g. struct A; is
  a valid statement. This permitted me to eliminate all the void *jcr, in
  favor of JCR *jcr, which pointed out a number of bugs in block.c.
- Change lib/bmisc.c to bsys.c (system routines).
- Add set_working_directory() to lib/util.c
- Remove some unneeded setjcr_job_status() since Jmsg(jcr, M_FATAL,...)
  already sets it.  
- Do not increment jcr->Errors for Fatal errors -- they represent non-fatal
  errors.
- Fix a few more places in FD where Errors was not incremented.
- Print unexpected (or incorrect) termination message returned from FD.
- Use switch() instead of giant if statement in verify_vol.c
- Protect overrun from do_shell_expansion() by passing max length.

2003-05-20 Version 1.31 Beta 20May03

- Complete implementation of Win32 streams in FD. Must test. Also,
  must implement new streams in SD.
- Make termination of daemons more "error" tolerant.  
- Make default "duration" days rather than seconds if there is no modifier.
- Install bcopy.
- Add detection of available Win API's so that a single binary will
  work on all Windows systems.  Reference those APIs through a pointer.
- Remove use_win_backup_api and enable it in bfile.c if system supports it.
- Modify dev.c so that it works if MTEOM is not defined (BSDI).
- Change MT_xxx to BMT_xxx to prevent conflicts with BSDI.
- Detect strtoll() in configure.
- Implement replacement for strtoll() for BSDI.
- Add platform files for BSDI.
- Use Jmsg() instead of Jmsg1() in acquire because File:line prefixed in dev.c
- Use Jmsg() in write_block_to_dev() so that no messages are lost.
- Rework autochanger code in restore to handle case of cassette not in magazine.
- Implement Windows BackupRead/Write(). I now have permissions right!!!!
- Additions to the manual (Purging, Autopruning).
- Add doc to code in autoprune.
- Begin adding Level = Base.
- Make Jmsg recognize console and direct messages directly back to it.
- Hopefully fix mess in mount.c when a tape expires.  
- Fix restore bug recently introduced due to Unix backwards status convention.
- New bacula.spec from Scott
- Add globals for database name and version and print them in traceback.
- Eliminate SubSysDirectory in each daemon conf file.
- Implement get_yesno() and get_pint() in UA.
- Make Jmsg aware of console. Messages now sent directly to Console.
- Created a single bacula.spec.in for by the MySQL and SQLite builds.
- Added proper configuration to console.in and gconsole.in
- Start adding textdomain() code for translating.
- A number of minor code cleanups.
- Rework shell expansion just a bit.
- Add rewind() when releasing a tape before acquiring the next one.
- Implement addition of Description in Service entry for Win32.
- Update manual to eliminate unclear autochanger points as mentioned
  by Dan Langille.
- Implement DESTDIR everywhere.
- Rework spec files for 1.31 and combine the main spec and the client
  only spec making a client package. At the same time, rename the packages
  so it is a bit clearer to the user. Also fix the build to work
  as non-root (scriptdir was not prefixed with $RPM_BUILD_ROOT).
- Correct Auto Changers and all other forms to Autochangers in the
  manual.
- John reported needing to do two "mount" requests, and indeed that
  was the case. It turns out that pthread_cond_timedwait() does not
  always return zero when awaken by a pthread_cond_signal().
- Include RunBeforeJob and RunAfterJob output in job output report.
- Implement a "real" Admin job that prints a mini-job report.
- Clean up a few error messages in findlib and filed.
- Recent changes to gnome-console caused initial output to be
  lost -- now fixed.
- The Win32 version crashed after each job. After hours, it turns out
  that when running with LocalSystem privilege (and not as a user), when
  Cygwin does pthread_kill(id, SIGUSR2), it gets a memory fault.
- Moved stored/fdmsg.c to lib/bget_msg.c, and moved SD messages to
  stored.c.  So now bget_msg() can be used by both the SD and FD.
- Changed Director's bget_msg() to be called bget_dirmsg() to avoid
  any possible confusion.
- Implemented bget_msg() in general everywhere in the FD except for
  job.c where the Dir and FD are communicating.
- Implemented a Director only heartbeat in the FD for the cases where
  there is either no connection to the SD or the FD is already reading
  from the SD.  start_dir_heartbeat() ...
- Add heartbeat to restore and verify volume.
- Add "Heartbeat Interval" to Storage resource, which sets interval the
  SD sends heartbeats to the FD and DIR, 0 disables heartbeats.
- Add "Heartbeat Interval" to FileDaemon resource, which sets the interval
  the FD sends heartbeats to the DIR, 0 disables heartbeats. 
- Added heartbeat from FD to Dir every HB_TIME rather than forwarding
  SD heartbeats.
- First cut label dialog.
- Turn on new semaphore code for simultaneous Jobs.
- Fix cancel trying to release semaphore's not acquired.
- Implement get_pint() and get_yesno() for UA.
- Implement find_arg_with_value() for UA.
- All command line "slot" to be specified for label command.
- Rework heartbeat code in FD to correctly terminate.
- Fix btraceback to use smtp and to eliminate double //
- Fix "storage" command to include ssl for verify and restores.
- Add Heartbeat code when SD is waiting on a tape -- heartbeat every 20 mins
  to keep stateful firewalls from timing out the connections.
- Fix src/stored/Makefile.in typo causing problems in statically linking
  btape.  Thanks to Lutz for reporting this.
- Create an is_client_alive script for checking if a client is alive.
  Using this script prevents generating error messages.
- Added corrections and updates to manual provided by Phil -- thanks.
- Added RequireSSL to each program/daemon configuration.
- Added EnableSSL to each correspondent for each program.
- Added the Console resource to the Director (need to
  implement individual Console authorization).

2003-04-28 Version 1.30 released
- Fix command history for gnome-console (must malloc).
- Add two cancel points in acquire_resources(). The job will not
  be immediately terminated in all cases.
- The new AutoMount code broke File archives -- fixed.
- Correct watchdog mutex race introduced yesterday.
- Add JobLevel to Admin run started by UA.
- Add -v to daemon startup scripts
- Implement bmicrosleep(sec, msec);
- Implement When for "run" command.
- Remove unsigned from socklen_t definition in hopes it will work better
  with older systems.
- Remove code that attempts to set PID dir and SUBSYS dir if they
  do not exist because it set them to sbindir!
- Modify mount to initially attempt to read the volume if Bacula
  wants a tape, none is mounted, and "Automatic Mount = yes" is set.
- Prohibit setting --sbindir and --with-subsys-dir the same.
- Fix missing argument that cause Kaboom in update slots.
- Fix orphaned bsock when UA gets error contacting FD or SD
- Nearly full implementation of Win Backup API, but it does not
  work due to lack of permission! Arggg!
- Implemented restoring directory permissions as they should be.
- Implemented reasonable regression script.  It found a number of
  restore errors.
- Implemented the following @ commands in the console that work directly
  in the console rather than in the Director.
    input - read input from a file
    output - write output to file
    tee    - tee output to file and terminal
    time   - print current time
    version - print current version
    exit    - quit
    quit    - quit
- Implemented new bfile io routines that will permit implementation of
  Windows native APIs for reading/writing files.
- By default always update hard links with the prefix, but do
  not update soft links.  It seems inconsistent, but it is what
  cp does.
- Implement wait command in Console that waits until no jobs are running. 
- Fixed the < code in Include/Excludes, which forgot to skip over the <.
- Do NOT attempt to chmod() a soft link as it will change the file behind
  the link!
- OOPS! Lutz ran into a problem. In attempting to prevent string overflows,
  I used bstrncpy() on a variable that was malloc'ed thus truncating 
  Volume names!  Arrrggggg!
- Lots of documentation of new features.
- Rework Volume name scanning in console, made much more logical
  and corrected a bug (confusion in calling sequence).
- Cleaned up a few error messages in cats adding more info.
- Add the IP address to error messages due to bad connects to servers.
- Implement default File output in config files so user can start
  saving right away without a tape drive.
- Protect inet_ntoa() with mutex in case it is not thread safe.
- Eliminate termcap from use in gnome console.
- Remove unused SD maximum volume files and maximum volume jobs. They
  are implemented in the Director.
- Make the default for Incremental and Differential saves to compare
  against both st_mtime and st_ctime rather than just st_mtime.
  This includes files moved or copied.
  Thanks to Matthias Wamser for bringing this fix to our attention.
- On Win32 clients, make a pass through the include/exclude patterns
  and change any back slashes to foward slashes. Prevents creating
  unusable directory names containing both conventions.
- Move ls -l output on restored files to M_RESTORED class.
- Make gnome-console compile correctly on RH8.0
- label barcodes now works.
- Implemented "update slots".
- Tweak btape "test" to always print suggestion for re-read last block.
- Implemented "Cleaning Prefix"
- Update alter_mysql_tables.in
- More work on barcodes.
- Zap VolHdr in SD when attempting to label a tape that is not
  there.  Prevents false tape names the next label command.
- First cut of bar code reading is implemented. It doesn't do
  anything but return the list to the Director.
- Implemented relabel command that relabels "Purged" Volumes.
- Check exit code in RunBeforeJob and err the job if it is non-zero.
- Remove old testsuite -- too complicated
- Print length when Authorization fails because of bad length.
- Fix problem of NumVols in Pool getting reset on startup.
- Implement full listing of DB records by listing them vertically
  instead of horizontally.
- Make changes to mysql scripts as suggested by Lutz Kittler
- Fixed code to write Uname to Client record.
- Fixed a problem (in btape) where Pmsg() was not printing.
- Moved re-read last block test to last in "test" command of btape.
- Lots of new documentation.
- Fixed newvol.c to handle retrying 10 times if the volume name already exists.
- Removed int_least16_t from sha1.h because it does not exist on some systems.
- Release job in SD if canceled and waiting on a mount (better cancellation).
- Prompt for Client in restore if not specified.
- Print "Selection is empty!" if no selection list found.
- Add new spec files and bacula.desktop from Scott.
- Update client every time a job is run.
- Add verbose option to daemons for printing more user error info.
- Test if console works with readline 4.3 (yes, it is OK).
- Release new depkgs
- Release new winbacula.
- Add Uname info to Client DB record.
- Improve error messages and make them more consistent when a non-existent
  Device is requested.
- Separated the -mwindows option so that only Windows programs
  are built with it (bacula-fd, ...) the tty tools such as console
  dbcheck, smtp, testfind, ... are now able to be run in a standard
  Windows DOS box.
- Add | and < options to Exclude the same as in Include.  
- Add typed in input to the text window in the gnome-console.
- Change function that gets the entry text (previously had orphaned buffer).
- Fix multiple Director problem in gnome-console (thanks to Lutz Kittler).
- Thanks to Renato, I was able to test Bacula on a FreeBSD tape drive.
  There are a number of significant differences: 1. reading less than
  the number of bytes in a record returns an I/O error.  2. ioctl(MTEOM)
  looses the file position. 3. Reading two two EOF marks (or ioctl(MTEOM))
  leave you positioned after the second EOF, so you must backspace file
  to be able to append.
- Added BSF at EOM = yes/no to Device resource to allow proper positioning
  at the end of a FreeBSD tape.
- Made btape "test" do much better testing of error conditions (i.e.
  it now ensures that the append went well). It will automatically
  detect problems and apply fixes and then retry the test, if it
  finally succeeds, it clearly says what directives need changing.
- Add Scott Barninger's rpm changes to the build environment
- Add changes to mtx-changer so users can add eject and sleep for
  certain autochangers.
- Implemented FreeBSD chflags (user defined flags).
- Turn restore errors during setting of owner and modes into
  warning messages -- for restoring files as non-root.
- Fix how prefixes are handled in restoring soft links.
- Modified btape "test" command to do only those things that
  Bacula actually does. There is much more explanation, ...
- Update manual.
- Finally had to back up to gcc version 2 from version 3 to avoid version
  3 nightmares.   
- Final cygwin tweaks.
- Move start time to *after* the resource locks are acquired.
- Unable to duplicate Phil's disabling of Bacula with nmap, but
  did make the authentication code a bit more conservative for
  dealing with bad input.
- Added code to the query command to escape all strings input
  before substitution and sending to the SQL engine.
- Escape user entered filenames for restore command.              
- Cleaned up the waiting code a bit -- using broadcast instead
  of signal and counting the waiters.
- Implement new pthreads semaphore code.
- #define new semaphore code rather than workq on USE_SEMAPHORE.
- Lots of improvements to the document to address recent support requests.
- Implement cycle through a set of tapes suggested by Eugeny
  Fisher with the "RecycleOldestVolume=yes" record in the
  Pool resource.  Basically this record causes Bacula to purge
  to oldest tape when no more tapes are found.
- Correct a number of small incorrect interactions between limit
  variables during recycling.
- Corrected a bug in db_create_media_record() where VolMaxFiles and
  VolMaxJobs was not written to the database.
- When the Director starts, the Pool record is updated in the
  database with the current contents of the Pool resource.
- Corrected bnet_connect() to immediately stop (rather than looping
  for the timeout period) if there is a fatal error (socket, or
  hostname to ip).
- Reworked "purge" code to make purging Volumes easier.
- Made "list volumes" list the volumes in all pools -- also
  "list volumes pool=Default" does not produce and error message.
- List Pool record after doing "update pool".
- Remove pid file code from Win32 -- not really necessary.
- Make bnet handle null jcr during cancel rather than crash.
- Add CygwinInstall.bat and CygwinUnInstall.bat
- Add db_lock() around newvol.c code to prevent race condition if multiple
  callers want a new Volume name.
- Lots of cleanup to Win32 code, with additional error messages.
- Make Bacula work on Win95 (test for GetAttributesEx).
- Add better error messages when end of media is reached or volume
  capacity execed.
- Turned off signal catching in readline(), necessary to keep console
  from crashing on ctl-Z with RedHat 8.0.  Thanks to David Craigon for
  testing this.
- Make the 3rd and hopefully final change to the Finclude structures.
  This new version permits multiple sets of options (more code to be
  written) to be applied against the same set of files. Thus one can
  have options that with match of *.gz and a different set of options
  for *.c, ...
- Integrated GNOME Console font resource code supplied by Phil Stracchino.
- Check for job_cancelled() in bnet_connect() code to stop wait loop if
  client not available.
- Fix early end of file scanning conf file in lex.c, which previously
  caused ABORT -- now reports error.  This could happen with an unterminated
  string for example.
- Move Maximum File Size code before write and detect error on writing EOF.
- Additional fix for Solaris 2.6 and a bdb.c fix submitted by Armin Buehler.
- Added detection for Solaris 2.6, which uses older setsockopt() calls.
- Defined sockopt_val_t for setsockopt() calls.
- Added fixes sent by Bevan Anderson that fix multiple connects to FD
  (I zap keys for security, so must put back dummy key).  Also a fix
  to the Internal database that wrote garbage after the filename in
  the database.
- Back out the __SVR4 changes.
- Add automatic configuration of socklen_t
- Attempt to fix problems reported by Lutz with multiple simultaneous
  open file Volumes (experimental code). Serialized acquire. This may
  fix the problem, but more thought and testing is necessary.
- Add table of "supported" autochanger models.
- Add Solaris 2.6 (__SRV4) changes sent by Peter Schmitz.
- Correct tape selection code in SD (|| => &&). Thanks to Chuck Hemker
  for the patch.
- Eliminate FileOptions. Implement new Finclude and Fexclude that
  have file options contained in it.  New structure must be transmitted
  to FD.
- Split Include/Exclude into new inc_conf.c file.
- Cleanup new Include/Exclude and FileOptions.  Structures in Director
  now correct.  Must transmit FileOptions to FD.
- WARNING:  With the adddress and port code in the Catalog you MUST
  remove old address= and dport= records!!!!!
- Added code to remove cancelled jobs from the workq -- needs testing.
- Added first cut AIX from output James MacLean sent me.
- Second cut of FileOptions.
- First cut of parsing FileOptions and Counters.
- Added address:port for MySQL as well as socket for local access.
- Fixed job.c in filed to properly handle excluded files. Apparently
  I changed the daemon protocol but forgot to update the code.
- Enhance testfind to handle include and exclude files
- Fix getdomainname() prototype for Darwin
- Added new -u and -g options for specifying userid and groupid to
  use when running, so that Bacula can reduce its privileges.
- When Bacula was hanging due to an NFS volume being down, I 
  fixed a few places in the File daemon where is should have immediately
  terminated the connection instead of waiting for the Director to do so.
- Added first cut support for Darwin.
- Temporarily comment out the O_NOFOLLOW to avoid possible subtle problems.
- Implemented O_NOFOLLOW in creating files in create_file.c to prevent
  creating a file at the end of a symbolic link.
- Use chown() if lchown() does not exist (e.g. Darwin).
- Always close stdin on startup to avoid having /dev/console attached.
- Change all DATE occurrences to BDATE because it is used by Cygwin headers.
- Add printing of Volume names in SD status output.
- Display all open devices in device chain in SD status output.
- All changing Pool in console run command.
- Thanks to Eric Bollengier for pointing out that the run_program()
  return status was not correctly generated. Now fixed (I hope).
- Corrected crash in Internal Database getting Volumes.
- Flush all daemon messages at the end of every job.
- Fix Install.bat script so that Bacula restarts after reboot on WinNT/2K systems.
- Minor changes in the gnome-console directory.
- Integrated in my old Tcl/Tk code into src/tconsole and moved it up
  from C to C++.  Pretty crude, but it is a beginning.
- Close syslog() %n exploit in message.c
- Edit space before each line in gconsole.
- Added INCEXE structure so we can have FileOptions.
- Added support for multiple simultaneous open file volumes.
- Fix hard linked files so that the one saved is always restored.
- Add * to restore "dir" listing to indicate marked files.
- Add ability to make md5sum and sha1sum in lib directory.
- Work a bit more on the new daemon protocol.
- Use unmask of 022 or more restive
- Create File volumes with 0640 permissions
- Added support for SHA1 signature. Need to modify DB to have type.
- Document SHA1.
- Work a bit on getting proper child status from bpipe calls.
- Added Ludwig's mtx-changer to the examples/devices directory.
- Added a Warning not to use the Internal Database when it is initialized.
- Compiled and tested SHA1, and added it to the library.
- Added code to print the "load slot" status after autoloading.

=============================================================================
2003-01-24 Version 1.29 released
23Jan03
- Tightened up permissions on all .conf files to be 640 so they are not
  world readable.
22Jan03
- Added prefixlinks=yes/no Job record to specify applying the Where
  prefix to absolute soft links.  Code is not yet passed to FD, because
  FD would then be incompatible with version 1.28.
- Added skeleton of installation for Gentoo release for Patrick Naubert.
- Add timer on open() for reading or writing a FIFO file.
- Put btraceback and btraceback.gdb in sysbin dir (a bit of polution,
  but at least dumps will work).
20Jan03
- Added "append" all messages to a log to default bacula-dir.conf
- Added WriteBootstrap to default bacula-dir.conf
- Made smartall.c print "Out of memory" if malloc() fails.
- Added pthread btimer routines.
- Added timer to FIFO open statement
- George was still having problems with VolUseDuration failing.
  On looking into it, one line of code subtracting 1900 was
  mysteriously missing from the source -- bizarre.
18Jan03
- Yesterday's version corrects all the problems I was
  previously having, and my production jobs are now completing
  properly.
- Added a #define dev_cap() to test the capabilities bits. I just
  makes the code a bit shorter and a bit simpler.
- Added phase 1 support for an output fifo device. The big 
  difference here is that it is a STREAM device, which means that
  Bacula will only write to it and not read. Thus, Bacula assumes
  that the correct "Volume" is mounted and will construct a valid
  label (without needing the Volume to be prelabeled), and write
  to the device.
- Added phase 1 support for input from fifo device (suppress re-read,
  add empty buffer flag).
17Jan03
- Improve printout of dbcheck with # files/path fixing.
- Zap SD authorization code after use.
- Added <> back to smtp (think about this some)
- Doc
16Jan03
- Massive change to add jcr as the first argument to nearly
  every db_ call. This is because I was storing the jcr in the
  db structure, which will not work because everyone shares
  exactly the same structure.
- More cleanups of error termination status in filed.
- Found another bug in message.c where %s was missing in JmsgN. A lot
  of cleanup in message.c
- Found places where filename listing was made (restore, verify
  vol) where the buffer could possibly overrun.
- Chain include files on the end of the list so that the
  order will be correct.
- Rewrote mtx-changer to output one slot per line terminated by
  a colon followed by an optional Volume Tag for the "list" command.
  Preparation for handling Volume Tags.
- My production crash remains elusive. Adding debug code or running
  under the debugger eliminates the problem. I found a case in
  message.c where I was extending the message string by two 
  characters to send it to the console. VERY BAD. Rewritten.
- Started implementing fifo and program handlers (i.e. streams)
  in the Storage daemon. Lots to do.
- Added a trace capability where trace statements are written
  to a file. Tmsg(). Hopefully this won't be used much.
- Running lots of "production" saved by scheduling a few minutes
  after the current time -- slow process ...
15Jan03
- Removed <> on From and To in smtp.c as suggested by James MacLean.
- Added code to suppress spurious error messages during cancel,
  but I was unable to eliminate all errors -- to be worked
  on later.
- Up size of print buffer from 2000 to 5000.
- My production run failed again. I'm beginnig to suspect 
  hardware problems because running by hand or under the
  debugger always works -- we will see.
- Added Update Volume VolFiles to reset correct tape files 
  a bit dangerous.
- Use the mysql_escape_string() rather than internal version.
14Jan03
- Cleanup handling of JobStatus by creating a subroutine.
- Fix a number of minor things with JobStatus.
- Print FD and SD JobStatus on backup report.
- Add JCR to findlib -- so now FD stops normally when cancelled.
- My production Director segment faulted during the second Job.
  I haven't been able to track it down. After rebuilding, all
  jobs finished correctly.
- In investigating the duplicated Paths, I found that there
  were 10,552 of them -- only Path records. After checking the
  code, I do not see the reason, but I've enhanced the code to
  print the full path name.
- I made a few improvements to tools/dbcheck. Mostly it provides
  a bit more feedback with verbose mode on when eliminating
  duplicate filenames or paths.
13Jan03
- During four simultaneous backups, the File daemon started
  detecting buffer corruptions. It turns out to be due to the
  fact that the smartall.c routines were not thread safe. They
  are now.
- Based on input from James MacLean and team, I eliminated a number
  of places where printf could be recursively called by using "%s".
- It turns out that because of an error of my understanding of
  mysql_escape_string(), the last argument was taken as the length
  of the string to be escaped rather than the maximum length.  I've
  now corrected all my code -- Thanks James.
12Jan03
- George Motter reported problems with UseDurations, and it seems 
  that there were a number of inconsistencies and problems with
  FirstWritten and LastWritten.  Hopefully for the most part they
  are now corrected.  Also fixed LabelDate if done through Console.
- Try to chase down reasons why there would be buffer overruns.
  Added P & V around referencing last_fname for status.
  Rewrote find_one.c with MEMPOOL, but not yet tested enough
  to commit.
10Jan03
- Give extra margin to converting filenames from Unix to Windows
  in attribs.c of findlib -- dumb cygwin API doesn't provide for
  a length.
- Added file:line traceback to size_of_pool_memory, check... and 
  realloc  in an attept to get closer to the memory overrun reported
  by James MacLean.
09Jan03
- Made yet another fix to quoted string -- paths!  Thanks to
  Scott Medlock for reporting this.
- Made | and < work.
- Implemented FIFO reading/writing. To do so, simply explicitly mention
  the fifo file (named pipe) in the Include AND add the new option
  readfifo=yes
08Jan03
- Started implementing | and < on Include names.
- Changed source to . in cats directory as requested by Andrew Kokarev.

=============================================================================
2003-01-05 Version 1.28b released
- Corrected a typo of working_directory in bacula-dir.conf
  reported by James MacLean.
- Fixed the fact that path and filenames in some cases were not
  being quoted before going into the database. Many thanks to
  James MacLean for reporting this.

=============================================================================
2003-01-05 Version 1.28a released
- Corrected a missing quote in bacula-dir.conf reported by James MacLean

=============================================================================
2003-01-05 Version 1.28 released
General:
- Implemented Bare Metal Recovery for Linux and manual procedures for Solaris
- Now using only a single technotes file kes-1.28 and will add to
  it as the development goes on.
- Wrote a general purpose bi-directional pipe command. This replaces
  previous use of pipes as well as the run_program previously used.
- Make BSRs stop if no more matches are possible.
- Allow unliminted number of devices in Storage daemon.
- Allow connections to Storage daemon before all devices are initialized.
- Better documentation (and btape test command) on using fixed block
  tape drivers.

Changes submitted this submission:
04Jan03
- Add cygreadline5.dll to Win32 release -- needed for console
03Jan03
- Add scripts make_catalog_backup and delete_catalog_backup that makes and
  deletes an ASCII copy of the catalog for backup. An example of how
  to use it is in the <bacula-src/src/dird/bacula-dir.conf file.
- Made a nicer column oriented listing of scheduled jobs for "status dir".
02Jan03
- Added backup/restore of raw partitions.
- Corrected restoration of files in root directory (problem with
  splitting path from file).
01Jan03
- Finally decided to cleanup handling of splitting path and filenames
  in the cats directory. Now the code is in one place sql.c and it
  is done using Pool memory, so there are no length restrictions.
31Dec02
- Add start of Solaris bare metal recovery
- Add Site Visit usage statistics to Web page
- Got Bacula listed on www.backupcentral.com
30Dec02
- Retest bare metal recovery on Linux 2 times with verify
- Cleanup printout of verify differences using proper casting to
  handle shorts and long longs.
29Dec02
- Added --enable-client-only to ./configure
- Modified --enable-static-sd to work better and documented it.
- Fixed Restore options (never,ifnewer, ...). They now work.
- Moved the stored.c Resource lock into the allocation thread so
  that the same thread sets/clears it. This created a problem on
  FreeBSD.
28Dec02
- Added more rescue documentation.
- Did a spell check of the Bacula doc.
- Modified bscan to use the working directory as specified in the
  configuration file as the default.
25Dec02
- Fixed an important bug reported by George Motter that caused only
  the last option on an Include record to be used (all previous options
  were lost).
24Dec02
- Chase down some inconsistencies in creating Media records from
  the Pool defaults, and in updating/creating the Pool from the
  resource. Also fixed the cats DB routines to include all
  fileds (VolUseDuration was missing for example).
21Dec02
- Added building static versions of daemon static-bacula-dir, ...
- Fine tuned the rescue (bare metal) code including support for grub.
- Added skeleton freebsd rescue
- Corrected SQL syntax error in autoprune code (JobType => Type).
- Added error messages for SQL errors in autopruning.
19Dec02
- Documented Bare Metal Recovery
- Create new "rescue" directory containg the Bare Metal Recovery code.
- Fiddle with SQL a bit for pruning as apparently the last InitCatalog
  was pruned after the expiration date eventhough it was the ONLY copy!
  I'm not sure this is fixed yet.
18Dec02
- Allow Director to pass a NUL where string to FD (fix in FD).
- Fix installation mv of query.sql.
- Make sure btraceback.gdb is not wiped on "make distclean"
- Corrected a bug in mod of replace options pointed out by Dave Anderson.
16Dec02
- Started adding FileOptions ...
- Fixed  and incorrect print out of the number of files restored (Jarif).
- Finally fixed EndBlock (and file address for Files) in catalog!
- Added hostname to tape header as always planned.
- Removed Level code (will not implement unless strong demand exists).
- Tweaked bscan to print number of errors ignored before first SOS.
- Enhanced btape "fill" to permit using one tape and to dump last
  block before writing and upon read back.
- Make fsf_dev() return 0 on fail and 1 on success.
- Use new db_get_job_volume_parameters() to enhance Write Bootstrap to
  contain more info (start/end file/block, file indexes).
- Added --enable-static-fd, sd, and dir to configuration to enable making
  static versions of the daemons.
13Dec02
- The btape test program was indicating errors on Adrian's machine
  using the ATAPI (ide-scsi) tape drive. It turns out that this
  is a fixed block driver as a consequence, Bacula must be setup
  to write fixed blocks. btape was not always using the fixed
  blocks defined in the Bacula config, so that has been updated.
  It now works fine. A lot of tips added to the Bacula test command 
  to help guide the user.
- Documentation of the above significantly improved in the manual.
12Dec02
- Added code in watchdog to permit setting and clearing child timers. If
  the timer expires, the child process is killed.
- Modified restore to handle differential jobs.
- Added a new test to the btape "test" command
09Dec02
- More documentation of new features (week position in scheduler, bsr).
- Re-read last block written on full tape to verify it.
- Fix segmentation fault with btape fill command due to missing FileSet MD5.
07Dec02
- Created better SQL input editing routines str_to_int64 and str_to_uint64()
- Pull Client from database in Console restore command.
- Create a Unique list of Volumes to be mounted (previously had repeats).
- Made many of the SQL searches better by using the ClientId rather than the name 
  in the restore Console command.
- Modified reading of a tape to include the VolFile info. Once the
  tape is past the specified file, reading stops.  The BSR now includes
  both the VolFile and VolBlock. Currently VolBlock is not used.  
- Handle multiple volumes better by creating a real volume list with all
  parameters in it.
- Display "At prompt waiting for input" in gnome console when at subcommand   
  prompt.
- Broke ascii to internal and internal to string editing routines out into
  new lib/edit.c file.
02Dec02
- Added a readme and an afs-bacula script to the examples directory
  that permits Bacula to backup an AFS filesystem. Thanks to
  Lucas Mingarro for the submission.
- Added A Sun-desktop autoloader script and Device definition to the
  examples/devices subdirectory.  Thanks to Lucas Mingarro for the
  submission.
- If the WriteBootStrap fails, the job will now be marked in error.
- Added a week position to the scheduler syntax that allows you to
  specify 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 4th, or first, ... fifth as a week
  position specification in front of a day. So if you say

    1st sun ...

  the scheduler will start only on the first sunday of the month.  The
  day specification can also be a day range e.g. sun-fri.
  This code is untested.
- Implemented bpipe.h and bpipe.c in src/lib, which defines a bi-directional
  pipe.  This allows executing other programs and sending them information
  as well as getting info from them.   
- Replaced the previous pipe usage with bpipes in RunBeforeJob and   
  RunAfterJob.
- The mail program now uses bpipes rather than pipes, which means that any
  error output will appear in the job output (truly bi-directional).
- Modified BSR to handle counts and to stop when no more matches are possible.
  This is untested.
- Improved error messages in smtp.

=============================================================================
2002-12-12 Version 1.27d
- This is a minor update that fixes a segmentation fault in btape
  as well as reduces non-important error messages in bscan.

2002-11-29 Version 1.27c
- Yet another silly error duplicating a column name in the SQLite
  make tables.  No code change, just a make file.

2002-11-29 Version 1.27b
- Set DB version to 5 in DB make files.

2002-11-28 Version 1.27a
- Use g++ instead of gcc for testfind in tools 

2002-11-27 Version 1.27 (26Nov02) released 28 November 2002

General: from kes25Nov02
- Mostly Cygwin changes

Changes submitted this submission:
- Updated bdb_find.c to have new calling sequence for db_find_job_start_time
- dird/catreq.c edit in Volume name in error messages to SD
- attribs.c switch to using the cygwin API to convert from POSIX paths
  to Win32 paths. This now permits Win32 path specifications in Include
  statements (all combinations not yet tested).  It also avoids the large
  number of errors seen by Lutz if a Win32 path is specified in the Dir.
- Update testfind help and remove set_attribsEx debug code.      
- Build testfind as default.
- Turn off debug message in stored/askdir.c

General: from kes21Nov02
- Another change in the database. You MUST either re-initialize
  your database or use the appropriate ./alter_xxx_tables in
  the src/cats directory.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Additional documentation.
- Added MaxVolFiles to the database (not yet implemented in code).
- Increased the database version from 3 to 4.
- Change VolMaxBytes to MaxVolBytes, which is much more descriptive.
- Compressed unnecessary spaces out of a lot of SQL statements.
- Changed many %d to %u where unsigned integers are used.
- Added the Bacula version and build date to each backup output.
  This will help knowing what version of Bacula was used.
- Implemented VolUseDuration MaxVolBytes, MaxVolFiles, and MaxVolJobs
  based on maximums set in the Volume (Media) record rather than in the
  resource. This means the values can be individually set on a Volume basis.
- Allow commas separating Include options (this was a subtle bug).
- Added maximum string length argments to a number of subroutines to
  prevent buffer overflows. Most notably was do_prompt().
- Replaced MANY occurrences of strcpy() with bstrncpy(), which guarantees
  both that the length is not exceeded and that the string is properly terminated.
  This has a risk of a certain destabilization -- as does the changes to
  the SQL noted above.
- In cram-md5 routine use my_name if gethostname() returns an error.
- Increase timeout from 2 minutes to 3 minutes in authorization code.
- Check the full string including \n in authorization.
- Throw away any response longer than MAXSTRING.
- Added a number of additional error checks on subroutine return statuses.
- Replaced as many lld's with edit_uint64 as I could find.
22Nov02:
- Added MaxVolBytes to Pool record - had forgotten it. Updated DB version.
23Nov02
- Update manual to document new Pool/Volume attributes
- Correct make_sqlite_tables (typo, plus missing value in Pool)
- Fix bizarre behavior in gnome-console and console when auth fails.
- Add Pool attribute query
- Add a few more error messages in askdir.c
- More strcpy() conversions to bstrncpy().

General: from kes18Nov02
- Did a number of cleanups of string copying to limit the length
  and prevent buffer overflows.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added a mutex arount the gethostbyname() so that multiple simultaneous
  jobs get the correct address.
- Added the MaxVolJobs to the Media alter tables script for MySQL (forgot it).
- Changed arg to db_find_job_start_time to be POOLMEM for returning the string.
- Add the new VolUseDuration and MaxVolJobs to all the db_ routines.
- Use bstrncpy() in most places in the db_ routines to prevent a bad 
  database from crashing Bacula (self protection).

General: from kes13Nov02
- You MUST either re-initialize your databases or use the 
    ./alter_mysql_tables
  or  
    ./alter_sqlite_tables
  in the <bacula-src>/src/cats directory to modify your database tables.
- Major improvements to dbcheck including an interactive mode.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Implemented VolumeUseDuration and MaximumVolumeJobs which control
  when a tape can be marked Used.
- New tape status "Used" means it was used and cannot be used any more.
- Defined utime_t which is 64 bit epoch time in seconds.  btime_t is
  64 bit epoch time in microseconds.
- Created alter_xxx_tables to add new columns (VolUseDuration, MaxVolJobs) to
  database. Incremented db version.
- Changed a few subroutine names concerning dates to be more descriptive.
- Fixed several places where the last filename was not stored in JCR in
  FD verify_vol.c and restore.c
- Major update to dbcheck.  Unfortunately I used subselects, which work
  perfectly fine in SQLite, but not at all in MySQL.  I must now rework
  it for MySQL. What a pain!
- Removed "Database found" from configure output. It was no longer used or valid.
- Corrected doc --working-dir => --with-working-dir  Thanks to Tuck for 
  reporting this.
- Added the database name to the error message for mismatched DB version.
- Commented out GMP and CWEB from configure as they are not currently used.

General: from kes09Nov02
- Converted the manual over to a new format written in wml. This
  gives navigation buttons on the top and bottom of each page
  as well as a standard page size.
- Updated the main Web site, providing a menu bar to the left
  and much better organization and presentation of the information.
- Added code to recognize a Volume written with a larger block
  size than specified. The code automatically adjusts. 

Changes submitted this submission:
- Created a new scripts directory and moved most of the scripts
  previously in the main directory there. This cleans things up
  quite a bit.
- Moved the randpass stuff into autoconf.
- ensure that the generic make_bacula_tables and drop_bacula_tables
  are installed.
- Added code to filed to allow it to be run from inetd.  Just add the
  -i option.  I have not tested it.

General: from kes30Oct02
- Alex found a problem with GZIP compression -- fixed.
- bacula stript fixes.
- Segment fault in Director fixed.
- Added openbsd to platforms

Changes submitted this submission:
- GZIP compression was broken for large files due to a variable that
  is changed during the compression. This was relatively easy to fix.
  However, there were a number of fixes required to make GZIP and SPARSE
  files work together. Found one more place in bextract where SPARSE_GZIP
  testing was missing.
- During testing of the above, I ran into the restore problem of multiple
  FileSet records. Fixed by including the FileSetId and the MD5 on the
  selection string, then always using the FileSetId. It is a bit
  confusing for the user, but ...
- Francis found a problem with bacula.in (fixed - thanks)
- I found another problem with bacula.in, so now it REALLY should work
  on most systems.
- Added the Replace options code for restores. Not tested.
- Fixed an ugly stack overrun bug in reading the config file
  that has been in for a long time.  I found this in testing on FreeBSD
  where the Director seg faulted.

General: from kes29Oct02
- Major change to the bnet communications routines.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Modified the bacula script to use pid files, so this script should
  now work on more platforms.  Updated devel_bacula as well.
- Added the full GNU hostname on the configuration print output.
- Added gettimeofday() to configure, and tweaked a few variables for
  OpenBSD.
- Added a chapter to the manual on Porting Bacula to other platforms.
- Documented in Tips how to use the WriteBootstrap record.
- Modified bc_types.h to error if 64 bit types are not found.
- Pass replace option for restore to the FD (no code to use it yet).
- Modify the FD to pass back the GNU OS string as well as the DISTNAME
  and DISTVER. This needs to be put in the Client record in the catalog.
- Major reworking of the bnet routines to eliminate the zero length which
  previously indicated a signal. This risks to create some subtle communications
  bugs.  The changes now permit blank lines to be sent from the user to the
  Director.
- Found and corrected a few more places where the Win32 attributes were not
  being recognized.
- Permit spaces in the Where string (restore) by bashing/unbashing them.
- Handle quotes correctly in the Console program (actually Dir ua code).
  Previously they were not handled in the middle of a string.
- Corrected two error message (error reading file), which previously stated
  it was a network error.
- Reworked the files in the binary Windows release. Removed unused programs 
  and added a README with the copyright as suggested by John. Also added
  console.exe to the release.
- Found and corrected an autoloader mount problem where the wrong tape
  was specified.  Previously it looped, then gave up.  Now it correctly
  detects the volume is not correct and zaps the Slot in the catalog.

General: from kes23Oct02
- I have mainly worked on getting all the details of a Restore
  to work correctly (new tape format, support for Win32 
  attributes, ...)
- Trademarked name Bacula.
- Implement Bacula tape format 11 (1.0 Immortal). This format
  will be maintained forever.
- Accept Any Volume is yes by default. This modifies Bacula's behavior
  when writing tapes.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Corrected a bug on FreeBSD where CFLAGS would get a "yes". I was
  unable to reproduce this, but a user confirmed the correction.
  It was a problem with detection of largefile support, which FreeBSD 
  has by default.
- Added a new "license" chapter in the manual. Re-licensed a number of
  library routines (bnet.c, hmac.c md5.c, cram-md5, ...) with LGPL so that they
  can be used in proprietary software to access Bacula if so desired.
- Move Director's AutoChanger doc to correct location (in Storage      
  resource). 
- Document why trademark (to protect compatibility).
- Implement and turned on Bacula tape format 11 (also BB02). This
  format moves the VolSessionId and VolSessionTime from each record 
  header into the Block header. This is MUCH more efficient when reading
  records as now whole blocks can be skipped.   
  Also added JobStatus in End Of Session record, and added MD5 for
  FileSet, which is necessary to insure uniqueness.
- Implement a new Bacula time format for btime_t. It is Epoch time
  in microseconds (i.e. base 1 Jan 1970 in microseconds).
  This replaces previous floating point times.
- Added Win32 extended attributes. In doing so, I moved all attribute
  handling from src/lib into src/findlib.  Added new streams for 
  Win32 attributes and for GZIP Win32 attributes.
- Modified "Accept Any Volume" so that it really permits any volume
  in the pool to be mounted.  
- Removed "Mount Anonymous Volumes" from Storage daemon config.
- Implemented sparse files. You must add "sparse=yes" on the include line
  for it to be enabled.
- Print "None" in backup summary rather than 0.0% if there is no compression
  enabled.
- Improved error checking in daemon connection/authentication code to prevent
  garbage data from harming a Bacula daemon.
- All daemon tools MUST have a config file.
- Completely strip drive specification on Win32 if a Where prefix is specified.
- Corrected DB info for writing to files. Now the File Address is stored
  in File-Block variables in the catalog.
- All Storage daemon tools now use common code for acquiring/reading
  Volumes.
- If a device is unmounted, report it even if the device is not open. This
  will help inform users who have BLOCKED Bacula by unmounting a drive.


=============================================================================
2002-10-12 Version 1.26 (10Oct02)
General: from kes10Oct02
- Changed Job name conventions to avoid : which is an illegal
  character on Windows.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added check for inet_pton to configure.in. If it does not
  exist (e.g. Windows) use inet_aton
- Documentation on GZIP.
- Another restore doc example.
- Documented btape fill command.
- Set default restore directory from /tmp to /tmp/bacula-restores
- Add additional no find error messages to sql_get.c
- Creating a bootstrap file on Windows failed because the Job name
  contained colons which are illegal on Windows. Replaced the
  colons with periods.  This corrects the Windows restore problem.
- Print number of files to be restored in "restore" command.
- On Windows systems, if there is a prefix, completely eliminate
  any drive: at the beginning of a path.
- Minor corrections to the tree routines to handle Windows
  files such as c:/ better. Previously it insisted on /c:/, which
  would then not be found in the catalog for a "dir" command.
- Modified cd command in restore to try /c: if c: fails.
- Add a new S_ISWIN32 bit to the st_mode word so that low level
  routines that create files do not print error messages.
- More work must be done to restore all Windows files correctly.
  Currently the following bits are not handled:
    Archive
    Hidden
    System 
  Also, all the dates are not properly restored.

General: from kes09Oct02
- More documentation.
- Implemented new fill command in btape that permits filling
  a tape and then reading it back to ensure that it works
  with Bacula.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added ReadBytes to JCR, which contains Job bytes read by
  FD, JobBytes contains compressed output of FD.
- Modified FD to pass back JobStatus, ReadBytes, JobBytes, ...
  for backup jobs.  This is upward compatible.
- Modified backup termination status report to contain the
  compression ratio 100 * (1 - compressed-bytes/uncompressed-bytes)
  This will always be zero if no software compression was
  done, or if you are using a version 1.25 or older FD.
- Pickup Job termination status of FD in backup, so now
  the termination status represents the state of all three
  daemons.
- Implemented new fill command in btape that permits filling
  a tape and then reading it back to ensure that it works
  with Bacula.

General: From kes06Oct02
- Implemented first major cut of bscan -- program to scan a tape
  and recreate a Bacula catalog.
- Fixed lseek() relative negative seek that prevented writing multiple
  jobs to a File volume.
- Implemented BB02 tape format -- currently turned off for writing.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Updated README
- Implemented new BB02 tape format, which moves the VolSessionId and
  VolSessionTime from the record headers into the Block header.  It
  is currently turned off.
- Implemented new btime time/date format on the tape. This is currently
  turned off.
- Added JobStatus to EOS tape label. This is currently turned off.
- Changed start_block, ... to StartBlock in JCR for uniformity.
- Print a message telling which tables were dropped/made with  
  ./drop_bacula_tables.
- Return JobType and JobLevel in db_get_job_record().
- Implemented get_current_btime(), which returns btime_t.
- Bump debug message max size to 2000 bytes.
- Add btime_t serial/unserial routines.
- Rework all tape label routines to integrate btime and other
  label format changes (currently turned off -- for writing).
- Fix lseek() to always be positive -- block.c
- Consolidate record, block, and label major #defines in block.h.
- Major implementation of bscan. Some more minor tweaking will be
  necessary.  E.g. add multiple records for multiple simultaneous
  Jobs.
- Cleanup lseek() to always use off_t as second argument.
- Add new "created" tape label (EOT_LABEL). This generates a callback
  to the read_records() routine when the final end of all tapes is
  reached allowing proper termination and updating of the media records.

General: From kes25Sep02
- Added means to bind servers to specific address.
- Documentation

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added DirAddress, FDAddress, and SDAddress records to the corresponding
  resources that allow the server to bind to a specific address 
  rather than any address.  This security improvement was suggested by
  a user -- thank you.
- Eliminated deprecated "Address" record from all sample Storage resources.
- Made quite a lot of improvements to the bscan program. Much more
  to do. Aside from details, it is able to recreate a database
  from which you can do a restore.
- The s option is not accepted on all versions of ar, so replaced it
  by an explicit ranlib call.
- Fixed a bug that caused the Director to crash if you rudely bring
  down the console program in the middle of an SQL command.
- Fixed a bug (missing break) that caused scheduled Admin jobs to
  be listed as "Unknown type".
- Removed old code from Storage daemon that used a separate FD port.

General:  From kes14Sep02
- Better key generation on non OpenSSL systems.
- 64 bit file address support if available.
- Implement autochanger for reading
- Lots of cleanup of tape reading code.
- Automatically create all Pool resources when Bacula starts.
- Implement bscan.c
- Implement autochanger use via the Console commands "add" and "label"
- Begin implementation of a regression script 
- Write bootstrap after ever job

Changes submitted this submission:
- After noticing that the non OpenSSL random key generator was
  not good on Solaris, John wrote a very nice randpass generator.
- Integrated John's makeSessionKey for generating the FD->SD
  authorization.
- Statically link tools (doesn't work on Solaris).
- Document how to debug Bacula (new chapter in the manual)
- Remove unneeded printing of error message in sql_get.c
- Free SD description config record (previous oversight)
- Bash spaces when sending Director names, and unbash them when 
  received.
- Ensure no divide by zero in rate computation in backup.c
- Implement WriteBootstrap in backup.c
- Allow tape reading to request volume information for any
  volume.
- Create all Pool resources at startup.
- Show only Backup jobs in Restore listing of last 20 Jobs.
- Handle 64 bit stat packets in restore.
- Don't do shell expansion on store_dir in config if string 
  starts with |.  This is used for piping the program for the
  WriteBootstrap.
- Ignore SIGHUP -- DjGnu was triggering this. 
- Implement autochanger for reading, many changes to 
  acquire_device_for_read()
- Implement callback for reading Volume. Implement in bextract,
  bls, and bscan.
- Implement bscan
- Add count to bsr.
- Fix Volume in bsr.
- Move autochanger code to new subroutine in mount.c

=============================================================================
2002-09-05 Version 1.25a (05Sep02) Released
- Fix unitialized stack variable in bextract so it
  will always read the currently mounted tape.

=============================================================================
2002-09-04 Version 1.25 (01Sep02) Released
  General:
- Added .cvsignore files in each directory to cut down on the
  CVS output when scanning directories and finding Makefiles
  and such which are not part of the CVS tree.

  Changes submitted this submission:
- Cleaned up a lot of the error messages in Verify, including
  indenting.
- Had to remove some of the "automatic" error message printing
  in the DB because they are in fact things that come up 
  for Verify but not really errors.


  2002-08-30 Version 1.25 (30Aug02) Beta
  From kes30Aug02
- Fixed a bug where only the first file was restored if
  it is hard linked. The other links were lost.
- In some cases of restoring to alternate directories, softlinks
  were not properly restored.

  From kes28Aug02
  General:
- Bacula backups now run up to 12 times faster than version 1.24
- Bacula can run multiple simultaneous Jobs.
- Had to turn off TRANSACTIONS in SQLite because it doesn't work
  with multiple simultaneous jobs (I'm working on this).
- Added a better Job printout for Restore Jobs.
- Added a save/restore Rate to backup and restore jobs. This
  does not yet subtract out operator wait time so it will be
  underestimated it the Job waits on the tape (mount/label).
- Fixed a major bug caused by free()ing a buffer twice in
  the Restore code. This made the SD more or less useless after
  any restore Job. Arrggg!
- DIR - SD protocol changed, both must be updated at the same time.
- DIR - FD protocol changed in upward compatible way. Upgrade of   
  FD not required, but recommended.

  Changes submitted this submission:
- Added bell to "make" when errors are detected.
- Changed default compile option from -g to -g -O2
- Additional documentation as usual -- much based on questions or
  feedback from users. Thanks.
- Fixed example config files to use new syntax and to have a 
  Restore Job.
- Define ETIME to ETIMEOUT for Irix
- Added JCR filed to DB structure permitting direct printing error
  messages from within the Database subroutines.
  Some error messages may be printed twice as a consequence.
  When I see them or someone reports them, I will remove the double.
- Added JCR to the bsock structure. This allows direct printing
  of network errors from within the network code.
- Made most "trivial" debug messages have level 100 or greater. This
  allows for easier debugging of new code using the range below 100.
- Began replacing all Emsg() with Jmsg() using a NULL as the JCR in    
  Jmsg() is the same as Emsg().
- Fixed several crashes in the Director because of malformed config files.
- Added SpoolAttributes to Job resource.
- Pass CatalogFiles to SD. If set to no, the attributes are dropped 
  within the SD rather than being sent to the DIR.
- Cleaned up a number of information/error messages in user interface.
  This includes eliminating the "pretty please" response in favor of
  "yes/no" to delete volumes and pools.
- Cleaned up quite a number of uninitialized variables reported when going
  to -O2, most were harmless, but a couple could cause problems.
- The cd command in restore was not working correctly (it didn't allow some
  legal cds).
- Fixed a segmentation violation in the directory tree handling code in 
  the restore command.
- Handle a few error conditions in the restore command better.
- Permit "Where" to be set to nul in modification of a run command.
- Clarified the error message for Verify if an InitCatalog has not previously
  been done -- thanks Chuck.
- Add MaximumConcurrentJobs to FD.
- Added code to mem_pool to die if a buffer is released twice.
- Lots of work done on SD for multiple simultaneous jobs. Split device.c
  into device.c, mount.c and acquire.c
- Started writing new lock code for SD, but may back it out -- needs more
  thought. Current code works, but is too complicated. Maybe can simplify it.
- Cleaned up the SD tools code quite a bit. Added bootstrap to all tools.
- Ensure that tape session labels are not split across two blocks. This makes
  reading them back much easier.
- Fixed another restore bug concerning tape labels on multi-volume saves.

=============================================================================
2002-08-14 Version 1.24
  From kes12Aug02
- Made a new tools directory.
- Moved smtp into the tools directory.
- Created a dbcheck program in the tools directory that
  checks for certain database errors and if requested fixes them.
- Put the database link flags on DB_LIBS so that it now only is
  on binaries that actually need it.
- Document dbcheck and testfind programs.
- Move testfind to tools directory.
- Check for FileSet after getting Client name in Restore command.
  Modify all necessary SQL commands to accept FileSetId.
- Add a db_get_fileset_record in cats directory.
- Correct list last 20 files concatenation to be MySQL 
  dependent. They aren't SQL standard. Use SQL standard || for
  other SQL programs.
- Modify dir command in file selection to produce a long form
  listing of the file/directory name.
- Add platforms/irix/*.in files to CVS
- Make Console command scanner accept quoted value fields.
- If after selecting Client to restore, there are multiple
  FileSets, ask user to select one.
- After obtaining JobIds for restore, ensure that there is only
  one MediaType, and select a Storage resource to be used.

  From kes11Aug02
- Made restore actually work.
- Made console and gconsole be configured (requested by Chuck)
- Updated kernstodo
- changed fs in Job record to fileset for clarity
- The console run command was not properly picking up the command
  line arguments.  Fixed!
- Changed add/remove/rm to mark/unmark
- Volume keyword VolumeName was wrong, changed to Volume (in restore bsr).
- Pass jcr to parse_bsr, and if non-NULL, it will output error messages
  to Job stream rather than Emsg.
- Modified lexical scanner to include caller context so that jcr can
  be stored in lex context allowing error messages to be properly 
  routed.
- Renamed the Job message chain to be jcr_msgs. This eliminated the      
  previous confusion with the default value, now named jcr->messages.
- Implemented multi-volume bsr records.    
- Implemented pm_strcat() and pm_strcpy() to cat/add to memory pool
  buffers in same way as strcat/strcpy, but expanding buffer.
- Modified db_get_volume_names to handle arbitrarily long Volume list.

  From kes07Aug02
- If the Console program terminated during the printing of messages,
  the message file was left locked. This was corrected by using the
  new read-write lock code.  
- Implemented Pw() and Vw() for obtaining and releasing a write lock
  using the rwl_xxx routines.
- Deleted some old pthread_mutex code from mysql.c
- In making the Irix port, I previously corrected the base64 routine so 
  they were not sensitive to the machine definition of char. This made
  them incompatible with previous versions invalidating MD5 signatures
  which are in base64 format. I have now corrected this, making the
  routines compatible with the previous version but also insensitive
  to the default definition of char.
- Removed some unnecessary NPRT() usage in signal.c (pointed out by
  the Irix compiler).
- Add back BNET_NONO for compatibility with older File daemons.
- Implement runing a restore Job in the restore command.
- Make installation of query.sql unconditional. To prevent you own file
  from being overwritten, give it a different name.
- Made parse_command_args() in ua take command from ua->cmd, this
  simplifies it and allows usage in other places -- e.g. building
  arguments for created run command in restore.
- Cleaned the naming of s_full_ctx to be s_jobids.
- Write the bsr created in restore to "working-directory"/restore.bsr
- Fix bugs in command line scanner in run command -- also some misplaced
  breaks!
- Eliminate static cmd in ua_server.c
- Eliminate segmentation fault when using the Run command in the
  Console -- forgot to init_msgs().

  From kes06Aug02
- Did a good amount of documentation.
- Added sql_cmds.c to CVS, forgot, pointed out by Chuck.
- Added new platforms/irix directory to CVS
- Turn off transaction debug code in sql.c
- Reworked the scheduler so that it handles the same Job starting
  twice in the same hour. Previously it took one or the other.
- Tightened up the "slop" in the timings that I programmed to ensure
  that the same job isn't run twice or that no job was missed.
- Increase the sleep time.
- Used job_type_to_str() in status so that Admin jobs are correctly reported.
- Add internationalization message chars to a number of routines
  in util.c
- Make the watchdog timer clear the mutex when it exits.
- Some tweaks to the Restore command. It needs fixing when a Job spans
  two or more volumes.

  From kes05Aug02
- Initial cut at adding Irix File daemon support.
- Lots of work on the restore command.
- Take a stab at eliminating the "broken pipe message"
  when the console program prematurely terminates.
- Reimplemented transactions for SQLite by keeping
  them all in the same thread.
- quit in the Console program now waits for Bacula to
  quit. To immediately quit, you must enter .quit
- Eliminated BNET_EOF -- this COULD have some negative consequences
  on interdaemon communications.
- Define Job termination status for Admin jobs.
- Write new bstrncpy() function that guarantees that strcpy is
  properly terminated.
- Fixed command input in ua_input.c to accept quoted items as a
  single field. 

  From kes01Aug02
- The changes that added indexes to the SQLite database were
  lost -- thanks to Chuck for pointing this out. Redone.
- Fixed a problem quoting strings in SQLite. This showed up
  as database errors with files containing ' or " in the filename.
- Implemente restore command -- still in progress.
- Added indexes to all fields in SQLite that exist in MySQL.
- Moved unused immortal files from src/lib to src/immortal.
  This will permit splitting depkgs.
- Started work on adding embedded MySQL. Cannot get the tables
  to work for the moment. Please don't try to use this option.
- Convert to using single quotes for enclosing all strings.
- Implement correct quoting algorithm for SQLite strings.
  Is dequoting needed?
- Started centralizing SQL statments in the Director in sql_cmds.c
- Changed a number of M_ABORTs to M_ERROR_TERM so that program terminates
  but does not produce a dump.
- Allow wild-card matches in bsr for Client name, and Job.
- Change OflineOnUnmount=no as default.
- Fixed improper printing of filenames containing a space in bls.c
  Thanks to Carlos for reporting this.

===========================================================================
2002-07-26 Release 1.23a
- Fix segmentation fault is FD status.
- Turn off TRANSACTIONs for SQLite.                        

===========================================================================
2002-07-23 Release 1.23
  From kes22Jul02
- Updated Bacula to handle some minor differences in MySQL 4.0.2
  (still works with older MySQLs).
- Updated MySQL documentation to correct some minor errors.
- Added kernstodo to CVS
- Fixed create_mysql_database, which I recently accidently broke.
- Disallow zero length volume names in Console program.
- Create alter_mysql_tables and alter_sqlite_tables for conversion
  from 1.22 table format to 1.23 table format.

  From kes20Jul02
- Investigation of SQLite performace problems reported by Chuck.
- Updated ChangeLog
- Updated README
- made root@localhost the default email address because many smtp
  servers reject root but accept root@localhost
- Added an autochangers chapter to the manual.
- Documented most of the new features in 1.23
- Modified the SQLite interface code to start a transaction at the
  beginning of a job and commit it at the end of the job. It
  also commits it after 10000 changes. Hopefully this will
  improve performance.
- Set the default cache pages from 2000 to 10000 for SQLite (i.e.
  about 15Megs of memory) hoping to improve performance.
- Terminate last filename referenced in FD prior to copy to
  avoid race problem with multiple threads and no locking.
- Enhanced the status output to include the JobType                
- Print an error message if the email program terminates in error.
- If your machine has an MTUNLOCK, do it before doing an OFFLINE to
  ensure that the door is unlocked.
- Added code to stored/append.c to spool attributes. This is in
  a testing stage and must be explicitly enabled.
- Added a no_attributes variable to stored/append.c that prevents
  the attributes from being sent to the Director. As yet, no way
  to turn it on.
- Modified SQLite code so that after 10000 updates any transaction
  is committed, then restarted. This keeps it from using too much
  memory.
- Set the default cache size to 10000 pages (previously 2000).
- Fixed a segmentation fault on Sun due to no default value for
  the JobStatus.
- Added the same indexes to SQLite that I exist in MySQL. This
  VASTLY reduces CPU usage for lots of inserts.
- Added spooling to bnet_send().

  From kes18Jul02
- The following two changes were prompted by questions/suggestions
  from A Morgan.
- If you have "AlwaysOpen = no" in your SD Device
  resource, Bacula will free() the drive when it
  is finished with the Job.
- If you have "Offline On Unmount = yes", in your
  SD Device resource, Bacula will offline (or eject)
  the tape prior to freeing it.
- Added Maximum Open Wait to allow open() to wait if drive is busy.
- Added RunBeforeJob and RunAfterJob records to Job records.
  This permits running an external program with the following editing
  codes:
    %% = %
    %c = Client's name
    %d = Director's name
    %i = JobId
    %e = Job Exit
    %j = Job
    %l = Job Level
    %n = Job name
    %t = Job type

  From kes17Jul02
- Added autochanger support to devices.c
- Allow user to change Slot in the Volume record.
- Implemented code in lib to run an external program
  (tape changer)
- Implemented a changer script for mtx.
- Currently the changer commands used are:  
    loaded -- returns number of slot loaded or 0
    load   -- loads a specified slot
    unload -- unloads the device (returns casette to slot)
- Other changer commands defined but not yet used:
    list   -- returns list of slots containing a cassette
    slots  -- returns total number of slots 
- Implemented ChangerCommand, specified in the SD Device
  resource, permits editing of:
      %% = %
      %a = archive device name
      %c = changer device name
      %f = Client's name
      %j = Job name
      %o = command
      %s = Slot base 0
      %S = Slot base 1
      %v = Volume name
- Implemented MaximumChangerWait default 120 seconds. It is 
  specified in the SD Device resource.

  From kes15Jul02
- Moved techlogs from main directory to be subdirectory of doc
- Added code for strerror_r, and detection of gethostbyname_r().
- The protocol between the Director and the SD has changed.
- Major rework of SD tape mounting to prepare for Changer commands.
- Separated Update Media record and Create JobMedia record. These
  are done from the SD by calling the Director. Need separate Create
  JobMedia so that when a Job spans a volume, all other Jobs writing
  the same volume will also have JobMedia records created.
- Added message to user indicating selection aborted if he enters .
  to a Console selection request.
- Create a jobstatus_to_ascii() routine for use in status commands.
  This makes a single routine from three separate pieces of code.
  Updated the code to properly handle more (all) termination statuses.
- Tried to fix the gnome-console to handle history a bit better. There
  are still some problems with focus not being properly set to the edit
  box after history replacement.
- Removed the shutdown() from bnet_close() hoping to fix Console termination
  errors that are occassionally seen -- no luck.
- Moved add_str() to lib/util and renamed it add_str_to_pool_mem() so that
  it can be used to edit Job termination codes and Changer command codes.
- Reworked how the SD mounts tapes (in device.c) so that control passes through
  only a single routine. The logic is much simpler than previously, and now
  adding AutoChanger code is straight forward.
- Made SD tape mounting much more fault tolerant -- more cases retry instead
  of terminating the Job.
- Wrote code to edit_device_codes() for Changer commands. Not yet fully     
  implemented.
- Added a ChangerDevice directive to the Device resource. Still need to add
  ChangerCommand.

  From kes07Jul02
- This documents what I did while on vacation. 
- A fair amount of documentation.
- Implemented Verify Volume to Catalog (needs renaming)
- Modified the database to include new MarkId field as
  well as Counters. Database level is incremented from 1 to  2.
- Added first cut of managing autochangers by implementing Slot in DB.
- Fixed a good number of M_ERROR messages to be M_FATAL where appropriate.
  Also converted a number of Emsg() to Jmsg() permitting better Job error
  messages.
- First cut at implementing a general packet passing mechanism for bsock
  to replace printf and sscanf for passing data.     
- Made make_xxx_tables and drop_xxx_tables and create_xxx_database
  for bdb as well as sqlite. With this each database has the
  same set of scripts (with the exception that MySQL has grant_privileges).
- Modified Makefile to only install the database scripts for the
  database that you are using.
- Updated the pdf script to include all the html files.
- Did quite a lot of documentation.
- Made Bacula compile correctly with DEBUG turned off.
- Implemented Pmsg() macros that permit using the debug print
  routines even with DEBUG off.
- Updated job_cancelled() macro to handle JS_FatalError.
- Changed db_find_last_full_verify() to db_find_last_jobid(). This
  permits working with Verify Volume to Catalog.
- Removed TRANSACTION code from incrementing NextId for SQLite. 
- Implemented quick and dirty (not fully functional code) so that
  console program does not die if ctl-Z is entered. 
- Cleaned up backup.c a bit adding a bail_out goto to ensure proper
  handling of errors with minimum code.
- Added passing Slot back and forth to Storage daemon with Volume info.
- Implemented Slot in Media record in DB.
- Implemented first cut of Counter resource in dird_conf.c. A counter
  resource is part of the Pool resource.
- Implemented necessary database record. However, the resource doesn't
  yet create a DB record.
- Implemented onefs (One File System) and recurse options on Include
  resource.
- Implemented autopruning of Verify and Restore Jobs.
- Did a better job of calculating thread_concurrency() for Sun systems.
  This permits better multi-threading allowing all the threads to run
  at the same time.
- Implemented a wait_for_storage_daemon_termination(), which is used by
  backup and verify volume.
- Clarified a number of UA prompts, and add feedback where certain commands
  completed but printed nothing. (More work to be done here).
- Added a pile of new code to implement Verify Volume to Catalog. It is sort
  of a hybrid of "restore" and "verify" in that it actually reads the tape,
  then compares it to the catalog.  Need Verify Volume to Client.
- Added a good number of checks for job_cancelled() this should permit
  quicker and more reliable cancelling of jobs.
- Fixed one bug in restore where I used ofile instead of lname, which means
  that if the lname was too long, the memory was not properly reallocated.
- Cleaned up find_one.c in findlib quite a bit.
- Link smtp static so that it works even if the libraries are messed up.
- If mail host is not found, retry with local host in smtp.
- Added slot and stream to the bootstrap record processing.
- Do offline on tape cartrige for unmount command. This can be turned off
  by the user in the config file. OffLineOnUnmount in Device resource.
- Implemented AutoChanger = yes/no in Device resource.

===========================================================================
2002-07-07 Release 1.22
- All the basic Restore code to handle the boostrap file is
  now implemented with the exception of the Console Restore command.
- Retained compatibility with previous Restore providing no 
  bootstrap file is specified. However, the old code (JobId based)
  will go away in a future release.
- Fixed a number of segmentation faults in the Console program due
  to printing of NULL pointers -- thanks to Chuck and his Sun for
  finding and reporting them -- mostly in ua_output.c.

  From kes25Jun02
- Null pointers now are printed as *None* if NPRT() is used.
- At the request of Phil, all resources are now chained in in the
  order they appear in the config file.
- Implement Bootstrap record in the Director's config file, which
  allows you to specify a predefined bootstrap file for Restore Jobs.
- Allow Bootstrap on the Restore record. This is deprecated.
- Implemented code to pass the Bootstrap file, if defined, to the
  File daemon, then from the File daemon to the Storage daemon.
- Added ability to set Bootstrap file in the Console when running a Restore.
- Allow scan_error() routine to be passed to lex_open_file(). This permits
  using lex in the Storage daemon without worrying that it will ABORT on
  a syntax error.  More work is needed to direct the error messages correctly.
- Improved error messages a bit when config syntax errors are found.
- Tested and corrected some errors in match_bsr.c
- Removed askdir.c from bls and bextract by defining dummy entry points.
- bextract now has bootstrap pretty well integrated.
- Changed bextract ABORTs into FATAL and exit(1) or ERROR_TERMINATE.
  More user friendly.
- Eliminated at least one lld and replaced it by edit_uint64() 
- Eliminated a few more _PROTO()s.
- Corrected a problem with the SQL for in query.sql for 
  Listing Volumes to Restore All Files

  From kes22Jun02
- Additional documentation.
- Reduce the time the jcr mutex is locked in lib/jcr.c
- More null pointer printing fixes in lib/parse_conf.c (debug output only).
- Added daemon filename to Kaboom message so I know what daemon died.
- Fix big bad bug introduced in watchdog.c last update that caused
  a segmentation violation (forgot to check for NULL pointer).
- Add a bit more info to bad returns from Stored when starting
  a job fails.

  From kes21Jun02
- Fixed scan_to_eol
- Fixed backup scanning forgot one T_STRING -> T_UNQUOTED_STRING
- changed all rwlock_t to brwlock_t to avoid conflicts with
  Solaris library.
- Added NPRT() macro to allow printing of NULL pointers, which
  segment fault on Solaris.
- Cast printing of pid_t to int for Solaris compiler.

  From kes20Jun02
- Added expect argment to lex_get_token().
- Added tree.c and tree.h to lib directory.

  From kes19Jun02
- Improvements to the bootstrap compiler
- Implemented first cut of bootstrap code in the Storage daemon
- Modified the authentication code to be more explicit during 
  failures.
- Added a few more debug message numbers with more arguments (Dmsg10, ...)
- Added more and more precise error messages when authentication fails.
- Implemented new "expect" codes in the lexical scanner that allows
  the caller to specify what he wants.                   
- Added integer, positive integer, 64 bit integer, and integer ranges,
  and name scanning to lex.
- Implemented new lex code in parse_conf.c, this reduces significantly
  the code.
- Hopefully fixed a watchdog race bug that caused the watchdog to time
  out a line after 1 hour rather than 6 days.

  From kes15Jun02
- Implemented a Bootstrap file parser and matcher.
- Implemented first cut of bootstrap code in bextract  
- Started clarifying different termination codes.
- Added M_ERROR_TERM to immediately terminate the daemon -- no dump.
  Also changed a few termination codes as appropriate.
- Fixed create_jobmedia_record() to include all the fields such as
  StartFile/EndFile, StartBlock/EndBlock.
- Print user friendly message when query mode ends.
- Fixed ls style print routines (bextract, bls, restore) to check
  buffer size, to print the link if any, and to used edit_uint64()
  instead of %lld.
- Moved scan_to_eol() and s_err() to lex.c to avoid dragging in 
  parse_conf.c for new bsr scanning code.
- New files: bsr.h, parse_bsr.c and match_bsr.c. parse_bsr.c parses
  a Bootstrap file, and match_bsr.c matches a bsr against a tape.
- use strcasecmp() in several places instead of lcase().
- Add first cut of bootstrap to bextract.
- Added File Size limit -- writes EOF after limit exeeded.

===========================================================================
2002-06-12 Release 1.21
- Fixed several problems with filenames being truncated if
  they contain spaces. Thanks to the user that reported this.
- N.B. To get the new queries, after the "make" and 
  "make install" you must explicitly replace the
  existing query.sql by query.sql.new.  query.sql is a
  user configuration file, so it is not overwritten.
- Added GZIP compression of Included files.  
- Added additional fields to tape SOS record permitting better
  recovery with no database.
- Be sure to remove any !terminate statements you may have
  in your config files.
- MUST UPDATE ALL DAEMONS due to protocol change to handle new
  tape format.

  From kes11Jun02:
- Updated examples directory with my most recent config files.
- Modified the M_TERM meaning to mean that Bacula has
  terminated in error without producing a dump. Previously,
  it meant that Bacula terminate (with or without error).
  You should remove any !terminate from your messages
  resources.
- Changed the order of the libraries in the link so that
  tcp wrappers link properly. Thanks Phil for reporting this.
- A user reported that filenames containing spaces were truncated
  in bextract. This was indeed the case. They were also truncated
  in Restore as well as in Verify. They are, hopefully, all fixed
  now.
- Made a few error conditions in Verify non-fatal.
- Modified the Console "query" command to permit multiple SQL
  statements per command. 
- Implemented three new "query" options: 
    List last 10 Full Backups for a Client
    List Volumes used by selected JobId
    List Volumes to Restore All Files
  To use them, simply type "query" to the Console program, and
  select the one you want.
- Modified bextract to default to extracting all files (i.e. /).
- Cleaned up the code in bextract a bit.

  From kes03Jun02:
- Improve Verify command to include files examined.
- Eliminate fcntl() locking of the console file and replaced
  it with a pthreads mutex.
- Note Director - SD protocol is changed to handle new tape
  information (Fileset, JobType, JobLevel).
- Create config.out that contains a summary of ./configure
  to see what you previously configured: "cat config.out"
- Implemented GZIP compression.  Added addition syntax to
  Include { } resource to permit setting of any GZIP compression
  level:
     compression=GZIP
     compression=GZIP1
     ...
     compression=GZIP9

  Level 1 is minimum compression and level 9 is maximum. Using just
  GZIP gives the default (level 6).
- Enhanced the tape format to include the unique Job name, FileSetName,
  JobType, and JobLevel in the Start/End of Session records. The code
  detects that tape level difference and acts accordingly. You can 
  add data in the new format to old tapes.
- Fixed an incorrect display message in the prune command.
- Began implementation of Verify Volume and Verify Data.
- Cleaned up File daemon restore.c a bit ensuring that termination 
  cleanup is done and all possible Emsgs are converted to Jmsgs.
- Modify bls.c to use common setup routines. This reduced the big
  code duplication that creeped in when I added different listing
  options. Also, changing tapes is now handled uniformily in a subroutine.

===========================================================================
2002-05-27 Release 1.20
- Started documenting Catalog Pruning and Recycling.
  Added catmaintenance.html and recycling.html
- Fixed the query command bug.
- Implemented PID files to prevent two copies of Bacula
  from running at the same time. Be sure you --with-pid-dir
  points to a working directory.
- Modified ASSERT() to cause a segmentation violation. This
  permits a core dump.
- Worked on gnome-console. It paints better, it tells you if it
  is ready to accept a command or processing one, and it is
  almost entirely GTK+ (rather than GNOME, I'm removing GNOME
  a bit at a time).
- Limit to 100 the number of tape labeling errors in a single Job.
- Add some additional ASSERT()s to the database routines. I don't
  like ASSERTs but they do catch bugs.
- Tested and debugged recycling of Volumes.  Needed to change
  the Director-SD protocol slightly.
- Removed the experimental SIGHUP in the Director as it is a
  potential source of errors.
- Added Level, Pool, Messages, and Storage keyword/value scanning
  to the Schedule Run record.
- Improved printing of Schedule resources with "show schedules"
- Do not autoprune Jobs/Files if the Job errs.
- Updated newvol() to pass back the updated Media record.   
- Fixed the "update pool" command, which was broken during a much
  earlier code reorganization.
- Improved a few of the pruning messages.
- Removed readline inclusions from gnome-console (hang over from console).
- Make Jmsg use daemon message handler if no message handler is defined.
  This is always the case in the SD and FD.
- Started removing __PROTO(). With C++ prototypes are manditory, so why
  keep around legacy code.
- Added a good deal of message internationalization -- more to be done.
- Move cached Path into mdb structure and use POOLMEM.
- Fix verify bug introduced last update causing incorrect diffs 
  by turning off autopruning.
- Started adding code to distinguish Errors from Fatal Errors.
- Errors are now counted in message.c for a Job.
- More POOLMEM cleanups.
- Implemented Automatic pruning.
- Implemented Automatic recycling of Volumes.
- Added PruneJobs/Files/Volumes=yes or no to Job resource. If set,
  it forces the specified pruning.
- Modified rwlock to accept multiple nested write lock
  requests.
- Modified the cats directory to use the new rwlock mechanism
  in place of P() and V(). 
- Defined db_lock(mdb) and db_unlock(mdb). They are in effect
  transaction locks. 
- Add CVS Id's to most files.
- Made first cut at AutoPrune
- Added new autoprune file that is called at the end of
  each Job. It then decides when and what to prune and
  calls the UA prune routines.
- Modified Run (in Schedule resource) to permit overrides of
  Level, Pool, Storage, and Messages. (not tested).
- Added more POOLMEM in place of char.
- Implemented daemon pid files. This prevents multiple 
  daemons from running simultaneously. You can run multiple
  daemons if they listen on different ports.
- Documented the Schedule resource a bit better.
- Began gently adding a POOLMEM type (perviously void).
  For the moment it is a #define to char, but long term
  it should be its own typedef.
- Corrected a bit of spacing on the status bar of gnome-console
- Added Admin and Archive Job types.
- Implemented multiple Messages resources. Each daemon has
  its own message resource, which defaults if not defined.
  Jobs may now have different message handlers.
- Cleaned up a bit of duplicate code in backup, verify, and
  restore by creating appropriate subroutines in job.c
- Added Type, Client, FileSet, and Level resource record
  definitions to the Director. These can be used in place
  of the Backup = ..., Verify = ..., ... commands.  This needs
  documenting.
- Corrected an incorrect message in the prune code and added
  the number of Files pruned in the message.
- Corrected several paint problems with gnome-console.
- Added a bit of printout in signal handler during traceback.
- Cleaned up most of sm_check() to be turned on/off by define
  in version.h

===========================================================================
2002-05-10 Release 1.19
- Allow the user to select a new period for pruning.
- Lots of additions to the manual -- prune and purge
  commands documented.
- Applied Phil's configure.in fix for --prefix, ...
- Fixed bug found by Phil (patch supplied) in updating
  MD5 signatures (revert to 32 bit FileId, move "static"
  variables into JCR) (catreq.c fd-cmds.c).
- Reverted to using INTEGER for FileId in make_sql_tables
  due to a bug in MySQL.
- Change editing code to %d for FileId.
- Remove sqlite in make distclean in cats directory.
- Remove console.conf in console during make distclean.
- Remove gnome-console.conf during make distclean.
- Remove bacula-dir.conf during make distclean.
- Set default level when using Console if none specified.
  Bug reported by Phil.
- A simple . command from Console is ignored.   
- Change program named from filed to bacual-fd in winmain.cpp
- Change default config file for Win32 in winmain.cpp
- Free namebuf on early return from find_one.c. Bug reported by Phil.
- Modify testfind.c to dump orphaned buffers.
- Removed terabytes from parse_conf.c because of problems with
  older gcc compilers.
- Turn off gnome options in gnome-console by constructing empty argv.
- Fixes to Verify when only MD5 differs.
- Insert 0 for MD5 as default rather than space.
- Allow .messages "transparent" command while reading input
  in UserAgent server.
- In dird/verify.c ensure that correct filename is printed if only
  the MD5 differs. Minor reindenting caused large diff.
- Delete unused code from backup.c
- In filed/verify.c ensure that same algorithm as backup.c is used
  to pass back MD5 signatures -- especially for directories and files
  that cannot be read. Change dummy filename from X to *MD5-id*.
  This dummy value should never be printed.
- Make gnome-console poll Director every 5 seconds for output.
  This means that queued up messages are displayed at reasonable
  intervals. Delete some unused code hanging around from the tty
  console program.
- Begin implementation of prune commands.
- Add command line history to gnome-console. Not yet saved across sessions.
- Fixed some broken URLs in the manual.
- Added JobId type.
- Wrote first cut of "prune files" and "prune jobs".
- Added command line history to gnome-console 2500 lines max.
- Widened store_time() and associated variables to 64 bits using
  new btime_t definition.
- Removed GNOME about box and replaced it with 
  a somewhat crude Gtk+ about box in the gnome-console.
- Widened StartDay in the Job DB record to be 64 bits.
- Changed edit_uint_ to edit_uint64_ everywhere. Much more
  descriptive of what is done.
- Removed most llds and replaced them with %s and edit_uint64.
  This makes the code a bit easier to read for beginners.
- Added a btime_t typedef which is 64 bits wide.
- Added most of the code needed to do Purge and Prune of
  database. Not yet tested. Please do not use.
- Additional config options for Console.
- Started adding code for Automatic Recycling of Volumes.
- Allow arbitrary length filenames in Verify code.
- Fix incorrect filename in Verify code.
- Significant enhancement to number scanning in config parser.
- Requires initializing MySQL tables, or applying cats/alter.sql
  to modify Media table.
- Modified Makefile to printer a much more visible
  message if the make ends in error.
- Added the Purge value to the VolStatus in the Media table.
  This value is set if the Volume is purged.
- Enhanced the db_delete_media_record() routine to delete
  all associated records in the database.
- Modified Console to always write to the variable "output"       
  rather than stdout. This will permit directing output to a file.
- Enhanced the Console configuration file to have a Console 
  resource. This will allow us to add an rcfile and history file.
- Modified Find_next_vol in catreq.c to search for "Recycle"
  volumes if there are none marked Append. Also made Get_Vol_info
  return the VolStatus to the Storage daemon.
- Allow upper/lower case match on job level names.
- Added another warning message to the Console "delete media" command.
- Corrected a number of FileId types from uint64_t to FileId_t in
  ua_retention.c.
- In ua server close database before freeing JCR (because pointer is
  kept in ua and jcr structures).
- parse all numbers as doubles. Do lots of checking for valid number
  formats. Allow numbers in scientific form (e.g. 1.5e+10).
- Remove terabyte modifier as it doesn't work in some compilers.
- Fix bug in handling some modifiers.
- Added all necessary code for Recycle to Storage daemon. A Volume
  marked Recycle will now be overwritten.
- Filled out the prune command a bit and did some testing.
- Make console accept redirected input.
- Altered the Table definitions to include Recycle,
  FileRetention, JobRetention, and AutoPrune.
- Widened StartDay to 64 bits.
- Use JobId_t in more places. 
- Added the new table fields to the database record definitions.
- Changed Recycle from string to a binary quantity.
- Added a Version table with a VersionId to detect.
  future changes in the database. This should prevent
  a Bacula from working with a database that is not in sync.
- Modify Console to accept input from a file. This will permit
  the .read command and allow reading a .rc file.
- Added new retention and recycle variables to the Director's configuration.
- The UA subroutines or commands can now be called from core
  code because the output routines detect the absence of a 
  UA socket and direct output to the Job.
- Added a verbose flage to the ua packet to permit reduction of
  output while running a UA command (prune) from a Job.
- Did a fair amount of work on the prune command. Prune Volume now works.
- Purge Volume now works.
- Made last changes for integrating prune and purge commands.
- Add -ltermcap to CONS_LIBS when readline is configured.
  More work to be done to search for termcap.
- Added cats/drop_sqlite_tables.in, which will delete the SQLite database.
- Got CWEB working so that we can compile filesys.w and immortal.w
- Modified depkgs to include cweb.             
- Note, CWEB is not yet used by the core Bacula code.
- Made cats/alter.sql, which alters an old database to bring it
  up to the new format. This only works with MySQL since SQLite does
  not have the ALTER SQL command.
- Changed the old StartDay field in the db to be JobTDate, which is
  the latest time/date in widened Unix time format that the Job ran.
  This value is used when doing pruning.
- Added code in cats/sql.c to verify that the database internal version
  corresponds to the db version compiled in Bacula. It is set to 1 currently.
- Lots of changes to cats to bring the SQL up to date with the new 
  retention period changes.
- Added Console command code to permit changing a Volume's retention period.
- Removed old code that used date_encode() and replaced it with widened
  Unix time().
- Started modifying Message resource scanner so that we can have multiple
  message resources. Much more work to be done.
- Moved scanning for time into new library routine string_to_btime().

===========================================================================
2002-04-22 Release 1.18
- Applied Phil's configure.in fix for --prefix, ...
- Fixed bug found by Phil (patch supplied) in updating
  MD5 signatures (revert to 32 bit FileId, move "static"
  variables into JCR) (catreq.c fd-cmds.c).
- Reverted to using INTEGER for FileId in make_sql_tables
  due to a bug in MySQL.
- Change editing code to %d for FileId.
- Remove sqlite in make distclean in cats directory.
- Remove console.conf in console during make distclean
- Remove gnome-console.conf during make distclean
- Remove bacula-dir.conf during make distclean
- Set default level when using Console if none specified.
  Bug reported by Phil.
- A simple . command from Console is ignored.   
- Change program named from filed to bacual-fd in winmain.cpp
- Change default config file for Win32 in winmain.cpp
- Free namebuf on early return from find_one.c. Bug reported by
  Phil.
- Modify testfind.c to dump orphaned buffers.
- Removed terabytes from parse_conf.c because of problems with
  older gcc compilers.
- Turn off gnome options in gnome-console by constructing empty
  argv.

===========================================================================
2002-04-18 Release 1.17 Kern Sibbald
- Ensure that platforms Makefiles are called for clean  
  and distclean.
- Hide a lot of Makefile messages with @
- Applied Phil's configure.in patch. Thanks.
- Doc updates, many to clarify points brought up by Phil.
- Applied Phil's make_mysql_tables.in patch. Thanks.
- Made authenticate.c in dird test bnet_send status.
- Make label a bit more friendly with extra info message.
- Add level 200 to debug info in run command.
- Remove old code from findlib/testfind.c so that it compiles.
- Add two minute max wait to cram-md5 authentication. Hopefully,
  this will catch non-responding WinNT daemons.
- Allow time and size modifiers to be upper or lower case.
- Turn off old CYGWIN patch for pthread_cond_timedwait() bug that
  now causes File daemon hangs on WinNT.
- Fix mount messages for restore. Previous updates to save
  broke the restore code.
- By default write fixed block sizes rather than variable block
  sizes.  My Sony DAT simply does not work (reread failures) with
  variable block sizes.
- Data split across tapes was not being correctly restored
  (at least on DAT tapes). 
- Implement MaximumBlockSize and MinumBlockSize statements in
  Storage daemon so user can specify variable block sizes if
  desired.
- Return error if block checksum error on read (previously 
  ignored).
- Fixed some error messages in bls, and in some cases exit(1)
  rather than ABORT. There remain ABORTs to be examined.
- Made a local copy of tcpd.h and corrected the function 
  prototype problem for C++.

===========================================================================
2002-04-14 First public release 1.16 Kern Sibbald
 - Many intervening changes/updates.

2001-09-29 Release 1.0 Kern Sibbald
 - Fixes to problems found at John's installation.
 - See techlogs/kes25Sep01 for details

2001-09-25 Release 1.0 Kern Sibbald
 - Helped John install at his site.
   He is backing up one Linux machine and
   one Win2000 machine.

2001-mm-dd Many releases
 - Released internally.
  
2000-04-09 Release 0.4 Kern Sibbald
 - Added a lot of Director configuration code. In      
   part (a small part), the Director now uses the
   bacula.conf file to know what to do. There still
   remains a lot to do.
 - The file search code is now integrated into the
   MySQL database routines, and Bacula is now hooked
   into the MySQL database (if so configured). Thus
   all the database records are being created, though
   there still remains some work in getting all the
   details into the records (such as the Storage 
   coordinates).
 - I've defined how Volume pools work (see manual).
 - I've defined error message handling though no code
   is yet written.
 - The following resources and records are implemented
   in the Director configuration file (bacula.conf):
    
   Director
     Name (passed to Storage daemon)
   Client
     Name, Address, Port
     Password (not yet used)
   Storage    
     Name, Address, Port, Password, MediaType
   Job
     Name    
     Type (not yet used)
     Backup (only one permitted) 
       Client, FileSet
     Storage
     Schedule, Messages, Pool (not used)
   FileSet
     Name  
     Include (options ignored)
     Exclude (no options)
   Schedule (not used)
     Name
   Messages (not used)
     Name       
     Debug, syslog, mail, append (not used)
   Catalog
     Name
     Address, Port, Password (not used)
   Pool (not used)
     Name
     PoolType, MediaType (not used)

 - Added Storage configuration routines.
   Director
     Name, password (verified against those sent by Director)
   Storage
     Name, Address, Port (address, port must correspond to Director's values)
     Password, MediaType
   Device
     Name, MediaType (must correspond to those sent by Director)
     Archive Device (defines device name)


2000-03-10 Release 0.3 Kern Sibbald
 - Implemented new base64 encoding for attributes.
   This eliminates some of the error messages in the
   sprintfs on the Solaris due to different stat() sizes.
 - Implemented  the first cut of the file search routines for
   the File daemon.  The exclusion lists work including wild
   cards.   There is a lot of work to be done, but the basic
   structure is now in place (wild cards do not yet work for
   the include).
 - Completed writing the memory pool code.  Now I must
   implement it in the daemons.
 - Modified the bacula start/stop script so that it has a
   better chance of working on SGI and Solaris.
 - The catalog code has not been converted to the new file
   search code.

2000-03-06 Release 0.2 Kern Sibbald
 - Integrated John's fixes.
 - Made Makefiles self configuring when Makefile.in is changed.
 - Added a runit script in the top level that runs bacula
 - Added a "bacula" script in the top level directory that
   starts and stops the File daemon and the Storage daemon.

2000-03-03 Release 0.1 Kern Sibbald
 - Basic Director, File, and Storage daemons.
   Standalone Catalog services using MySQL

2000-01-22 Kern Sibbald
